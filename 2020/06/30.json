(Fred Hutch Photo)\n\nUpdated with Fred Hutch confirmation and additional details.\n\nSeattle\u2019s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is cutting more than 70 jobs, about 2% of its workforce of more than 3,000 people, GeekWire has learned.\n\nIn internal messages about the job cuts, Fred Hutch officials cite the impact of the economic downturn on the research institution\u2019s budget. The layoffs are in non-scientific positions, reducing the implications for its core research initiatives.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday morning, following this report, Fred Hutch confirmed that it is making 76 layoffs from its South Lake Union campus, and also eliminating 81 open positions.\n\n\u201cThe layoffs come after a series of cost-cutting measures implemented since March,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThese latest steps are intended to reduce a projected revenue shortfall of nearly $50 million over the next 12 months due to increased volatility in variable revenue sources including philanthropy and investment income. Although the percentage of impacted positions is less than 5% of the center\u2019s overall workforce, the layoffs are all from the center\u2019s Administrative Division.\u201d\n\nThose prior cost-cutting initiatives included limiting spending on consultants and vendors, restricting hiring, eliminating salary increases for the upcoming fiscal year, and reducing executive salaries by 5%, Fred Hutch said in the statement. Executives also waived variable compensation representing up to 20% of their 2020 base salaries.\n\nDr. Thomas Lynch has been president of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center since February. (Fred Hutch Photo)\n\n\u201cThese are already exceptionally difficult times, and these layoffs add to the pain and deep sense of loss, especially for those colleagues who are leaving us today,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Lynch, the Fred Hutch president, in an email message to employees. (Full message below.)\n\nFred Hutch\u00a0reported operating revenues of $714 million in its 2019 fiscal year, 56% of which came from contracts and government grants, 16 percent from gifts and philanthropic grants, and 6 percent from investment income. The 44-year-old organization is ranked first in National Institutes of Health funding among all U.S. independent research centers.\n\nThe institution is a life sciences and biotech powerhouse in the Seattle region, spinning off numerous startups and providing the scientific underpinnings for major companies including Adaptive Biotechnologies and Juno Therapeutics.\n\nIn addition to Fred Hutch\u2019s core cancer research initiatives, scientists in its Infectious Disease Division have emerged as leaders in the effort to understand, track and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the midst of the global pandemic.\n\nLynch, a cancer research veteran, joined Fred Hutch five months ago as its new president and director. Fred Hutch last week named a new board chair and made other changes in its board of trustees. The changes coincide with the June 30 end of the institution\u2019s 2020 fiscal year.\n\nSeparately, Fred Hutch laid off 14 people as part of a broader restructuring of its internal data science initiatives in March, but said that decision was in the works for a few months and was unrelated to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe layoffs being announced today are on a scale similar to the cuts made by Fred Hutch in April 2009, as the economic impact of the recession took hold.\n\nHere is the full text of Lynch\u2019s message to Fred Hutch employees.\n\nToday marks a difficult day for our Fred Hutch community.\n\nAs you know, Fred Hutch is not immune to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s financial impacts. Despite our centerwide efforts to reduce expenses, we were not able to fully cover a projected revenue shortfall of nearly $50 million. In order to sustain our pursuit of cures for cancer and viral diseases, today we notified 76 employees that they are being laid off. We are also eliminating 81 open positions.\n\nThese are already exceptionally difficult times, and these layoffs add to the pain and deep sense of loss, especially for those colleagues who are leaving us today.\n\nAlthough the effects of these steps will be felt by everyone in the organization, the layoffs and eliminated positions are all in our Administrative Division. All the affected roles are funded not by direct grant support but by other revenue streams, including Facilities & Administrative revenue from grants, philanthropy and investment income. These revenue sources are being affected by the economic downturn related to COVID-19, and they remain uncertain as long as the volatility continues.\n\nWe made the extremely difficult decision to implement layoffs only after enacting a series of other cost-saving measures and thoroughly evaluating a range of additional options. Our approach to budget planning throughout this pandemic has centered on supporting Fred Hutch research using the resources we have in the most efficient way. The steps we have taken, including today\u2019s reduction in staffing, are all aimed at preserving the strength of our science and our ability to fulfill our mission far into the future.\n\nEvery employee laid off today will receive a transition package that includes severance pay, health benefit continuation for those who use our benefits, and a number of other services including job-search support. We will also ensure that any qualified and affected employees who are interested in roles that open at the center in the future are interviewed for those positions.\n\nTo those who are leaving, we are grateful for your passion, dedication, and everything you have contributed to our Hutch community and our mission. You are our colleagues and friends, and you will be missed.\n\nIn my short time here, I\u2019ve been struck by the deep care and concern Hutch employees have for one another. I know you will continue to support each other.\n\nAs difficult as these decisions are, our intent is to ensure that the Hutch rebounds swiftly when the economic situation improves, and we will continue to advance the center\u2019s lifesaving work even as we confront the losses and navigate the challenges presented by this global crisis.\n\nI remain committed to keeping you informed and will devote our town hall this afternoon to discussing today\u2019s news and taking your questions.\n\nThank you again for your compassion, hard work and commitment to the Hutch\u2019s science, our community and our mission.\n\n\t\nTodd Bishop\u00a0is GeekWire's co-founder and editor, a longtime business and technology journalist who covers topics including Amazon, Microsoft, startups, AI, the cloud and health tech, and hosts GeekWire's weekly podcast.

join the University of Cambridge.\nHusz\u00e1r was one of the first employees at London-based machine learning start-up Magic Pony, which was acquired by Twitter for a reported $150 million in 2016.\u00a0\nSocial media apps displayed on a smartphone.\nFabian Sommer | picture alliance | Getty Images\n\nArtificial intelligence expert Ferenc Husz\u00e1r is set to leave his full-time role at Twitter and join the University of Cambridge.\n\nHis departure comes four years after the micro-blogging platform acquired the London start-up he worked at, Magic Pony, for a reported $150 million.\n\nHusz\u00e1r, who is a senior machine learning engineer at Twitter's London office, is joining Cambridge's Department of Computer Science and Technology, where he completed a PhD in 2012.\u00a0\n\n\"I can confirm that I'm taking up a role at Cambridge,\"\u00a0Husz\u00e1r told CNBC via email. \"This also means that I will not indeed be full-time employed by Twitter,\" he added. \"I will miss the team and company very much.\"\n\nHusz\u00e1r, who was one of the first employees at Magic Pony, is expected to start at Cambridge on July 7.\u00a0\n\nThe university said Husz\u00e1r has an \"outstanding academic record and is a highly creative researcher with broad interests in many areas of machine learning.\"\u00a0\n\nThe move is a relatively rare example of an AI specialist moving from a big tech company to academia. Indeed, it normally happens the other way round.\u00a0\n\nIn recent years, U.S. tech giants have used large salaries to lure top professors away from universities around the world, leading to concerns of an academic brain drain.\u00a0\n\nSome AI researchers at Elon Musk's OpenAI are on salaries in excess of $1 million, according to The New York Times.\u00a0\n\nVideo compression\n\nMagic Pony developed technology to improve the quality of compressed videos so they may be enjoyed at higher quality when limited bandwidth is available. The software complemented existing compression technology but it didn't substitute it.\u00a0\n\nAt the time of the acquisition,\u00a0Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said\u00a0Magic Pony's technology would be used to boost live and video offerings and that the company's technology \"opens up a whole lot of exciting creative possibilities for Twitter.\"\n\nAt Cambridge, Husz\u00e1r will work alongside Professor Neil Lawrence, who left his job at director of machine learning role at Amazon last year to take up a role at the centuries-old university that is funded by Alphabet-owned AI lab DeepMind.\n\n\"We're very excited to welcome Ferenc to Cambridge,\" Lawrence told CNBC. \"He is a rare example of an individual who has deep insight into the theory of machine learning algorithms as well as practical experience of deploying these algorithms at scale.\"\n\n\"This mix of understanding is vital to ensure academic machine learning continues to be driven by the real challenges industry face in deploying safe, reliable, fair and interpretable machine learning.\"\n\nOther new machine learning hires at Cambridge include Carl Henrik Ek, who is joining from the University of Bristol, and Nicholas Lane who is joining from the University of Oxford.\n\nTwitter declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO\nLicensing & Reprints\nCNBC Councils\nSupply Chain Values\nCNBC on Peacock\nAdvertise With Us\nJoin the CNBC Panel\nDigital Products\nNews Releases\nClosed Captioning\nCorrections\nAbout CNBC\nInternships\nSite Map\nAd Choices\nCareers\nHelp\nContact\nNews Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

The company claims the centre will create more than 1,500 jobs, including an extra 700 jobs in construction.\n\nMore than 11 million items will be stocked at the new centre. Robots will speed up the order processing time by moving shelves to employees. They will cut down the time it takes stow items away or pick them up for new orders. The robots are also designed to save space, allowing 50% more items to be stowed per square metre.\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said in a statement the jobs come \"at a time when we need them most.\"\n\n\"Amazon\u2019s decision to locate its first robotic centre in the Southern Hemisphere right here in Western Sydney is another great example about what the future holds,\" she said.\n\nThis will be a mammoth building, with the floor area to be around 200,000 square metres across four levels \u2013 roughly the same land size of Taronga Zoo.\n\nAmazon Australia director of operations Craig Fuller said in a statement, \"The Amazon Robotics fulfilment centre will more than double our operational footprint in Australia, enhance efficiency and safety for our associates while ultimately providing customers with wider selection and faster delivery.\n\n\"This investment will also benefit the 10,000 plus small & medium sized businesses who utilise Fulfilment By Amazon to seamlessly service customers across the country.\"\n\nThere are more than 50 Amazon robotic fulfilment centres around the world\n\nAmazon has more than 175 fulfilment centres around the world and more than 50 robotics fulfilment centres.\n\nThe company expanded its automation efforts in the United States in 2019, rolling out machines to box up customer orders in a number of existing fulfilment centres. The jobs picture was less rosy there \u2013 Reuters reported that the robots were set to replace up to 1,300 jobs across 55 fulfilment centers.\n\nThe automation effort has been a long-term project, which accelerated back in 2012 when Amazon acquired robotics firm Kiva for $775 million.\n\nIn Australia, the company already has three fulfilment centres, including one in Dandenong, Melbourne, in Moorebank, Sydney and in Perth's Airport precinct. More recently, Amazon announced the development of a fourth fulfilment centre in Lytton, Brisbane which should start operating before Christmas 2020.\n\n\"The project will contribute to local workforce development and provide skilled employment in areas like robotics, logistics and supply chain,\" Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney Stuart Ayres said in a statement.\n\n\"It will also help build our local e-commerce sector, giving small and medium-sized businesses access to Amazon\u2019s packing, shipping, customer service and returns capabilities, along with easier access to millions of customers customers across Australia and the world.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated this was Amazon\u2019s fourth facility in Australia.

To get it delivered weekly to your in-box,\u00a0sign up here.\n\nA lot of A.I. companies are having a good year\u2014and that includes those who sell A.I.-enabled tech to lawyers.\n\nLast week, I spoke with Jason Brennan, the chief executive officer of U.K.-based legal A.I. company Luminance. He told me the company, which now has more than 250 customers across the globe, including a fifth of the world\u2019s largest 100 law firms, has had a 30% increase in customers since the start of 2020.\n\nLuminance has an interesting history: It was founded in 2015 by a group that included Mike Lynch, the former founder and CEO of one-time star U.K. technology company Autonomy. (Lynch is fighting extradition to the U.S. on fraud charges and is awaiting a verdict in a civil fraud suit in the U.K.) Lynch\u2019s Invoke Capital has been one of Luminance\u2019s biggest funders, but the company is also backed by venture capital firm Talis Capital and the big U.K.-based law firm Slaughter & May (which was also one of Luminance\u2019s first customers and, what's more, advised Autonomy in the merger with Hewlett-Packard that ultimately landed Lynch in legal hot water).\n\nLuminance's machine learning platform uses some elements of natural language processing, the kind of machine learning that can understand language, and some elements of clustering, a machine learning discipline focused on, as the name suggests, grouping data based on similarities and differences.\n\nClustering is one of the unsupervised learning techniques (ones that don't rely on a pre-labeled training data set) that are increasingly gaining ground in business applications. In the case of Luminance, its system uses both unsupervised learning and supervised methods\u2014while its software knows that a certain set of documents are similar, it doesn't know what they are until a human lawyer training the system applies a label to them. Once the document set is labelled, the system can learn to predict the right label for akin documents it encounters in the future.\n\nThe result is a system that can tell lawyers which documents\u2014and importantly, which clauses within documents\u2014are most similar and which are outliers.\n\nThis is important because it turns out that a lot of the \u201cgrunt work\u201d of Big Law involves doing exactly what Luminance does: combing through vast troves of documents, trying to find those clauses that might be problematic. Maybe they need to be updated due to a regulatory change. Or maybe they are part of the contracts held by a company that is being acquired and would open up a big liability issue for the buyer. Either way, law firms once deployed small armies of paralegals and junior associates to find them. It used to be that law firms could simply charge for all this labor and pass the cost on to the client. But that hasn\u2019t been true for at least a decade. These days, clients are more likely to demand law firms accept a flat fee for this sort of work, or pay based on some pre-agreed outcome, not on man hours. So firms have had to become much more efficient. Corporate in-house legal departments are also having to do more with less.\n\nThat's good for Luminance. And Brennan tells me that during the pandemic, the company has seen its customers use its A.I. in novel ways. Take the Italian law firm Portolano Cavallo and the U.K. arm of the global firm Dentons. Both firms found their clients needed to quickly determine if any contracts had force majeure clauses and exactly how they could be triggered. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea of needing to pivot very quickly to something new and unforeseen,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cForce majeure clauses have been out there forever, but the relevance of it couldn\u2019t be predicted.\u201d Using Luminance, both Dentons and Portolano were able to complete this task in record time\u2014in fact, Portolano says in a client newsletter that it was able to complete a document review that might have taken many days in just 45 minutes.\n\nBrennan says he's seen other interesting uses such as companies gaming out which creditors might be on the hook in potential bankruptcies, investigating M&A transactions as many industries brace for consolidation, and even preparing for possible class action lawsuits against the cruise line industry.\n\nLike many A.I. company CEOs, Brennan says his customers are not simply using his product to cut costs. He says A.I. is also enabling them to find new revenue streams. For instance, in the past, in big M&A transactions, the likes of the Fortune 500 would engage a big global law firm to conduct a due diligence review of contracts above a certain pre-agreed dollar value. It was simply too onerous and too expensive to look at everything. And, once a merger actually came together, the work of integrating the combined firms' contracts was often farmed out to smaller law firms, since it was too pricey to get a large one to do it, Brennan says. But now A.I. systems such as Luminance are allowing the big firms to offer comprehensive document reviews and actually retain the post-merger integration work. At the same time, they're also allowing some smaller firms to compete for work that they wouldn't have had the manpower to handle before, he says.\n\nSo, how long will it be until we have fully robotic lawyers? Well, Brennan thinks the day when software like Luminance will actually perform legal analysis\u2014assessing which clauses are most likely to trigger a legal issue, for instance\u2014is still a long way off. \u201cWe want lawyers to be lawyers,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now we are focused on highlighting information to lawyers and letting them do what they do best.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, here\u2019s the rest of this week\u2019s A.I. news.\n\nJeremy Kahn\n@Jeremyakahn\nJeremy.Kahn@fortune.com\n\nThis story has been corrected to clarify that law firm Slaughter & May represented Autonomy in its sale to Hewlett Packard but has not represented Mike Lynch personally. The spelling of Meri Williams's first name in the \"Eye on A.I. Talent\" section has also been corrected.\n\nA.I. IN THE NEWS\n\nDemocrats introduce a bill to ban facial recognition following false arrest case. A group of Democratic lawmakers have crafted a bill to ban the federal government and U.S. police departments from using facial recognition software. The bill comes in the wake of news that a Black man in Detroit had been arrested in January for a theft he did not commit after facial recognition software erroneously identified him as the person in store surveillance video of the crime. Researchers have found that many leading facial recognition algorithms are less accurate in identifying Black people and others with darker-skin. \u201cIn this moment, the only responsible thing to do is to prohibit government and law enforcement from using these surveillance mechanisms,\u201d Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said. For more on the proposed law, check out this story by my Eye on A.I. co-author Jonathan Vanian.\u00a0\n\nTrump suspends H1B visa program. Donald Trump issued an executive order temporarily suspending approvals for H1B and other work visas, Tens of thousands of skilled foreign workers, including many in the technology sector such as machine learning engineers and researchers, come to work in the U.S. each year under these programs. My Fortune colleague Grady McGregor has a story on the new policy\u2019s potential impact here. Many experts in the geopolitics of A.I. are alarmed by the move, given how reliant the U.S. is on foreign-born tech talent.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAmazon buys self-driving company Zoox.\u00a0The Everything Store is paying about $1.2 billion to acquire the startup, according to a report in\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0Reports of a possible deal had first surfaced a month ago, also in The Journal. Amazon is thought to be interested in self-driving technologies as a way to one day automate its delivery fleet, but for now ,Zoox says Amazon will help roll out the self-driving taxi service it\u2019s been developing. Amazon has previously made minority investments in self-driving truck company Rivian Automotive and self-driving company Aurora Innovation, which also is now working on a self-driving truck. Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk used the Zoox acquisition as an opportunity to try to troll Jeff Bezos, accusing him on Twitter of being a \u201ccopy cat.\u201d It is the latest example of Musk\u2019s displeasure with Amazon, which he has called a \u201cmonopoly\u201d that should be broken up.\n\nNvidia teams up with Mercedes on A.I.-enabled cars.\u00a0The chip giant and the carmaker have signed a deal that will have Nvidia\u2019s computer chips and software installed in new Mercedes beginning in 2024, according to an Nvidia press release. The partnership will help power some existing features, such as smart cruise control and automatic lane-following-and-changing, and will also allow the cars to be upgraded over time to more and more autonomous-driving functions.\n\nGoogle launches a new A.I. image app. Google has unveiled a new A.I.-powered app called Keen. It allows users to pull together a lot of different kinds of information on theme, including Google search results and links as well as images. The app then uses machine learning to suggest similar or related information. You can read more about it and play around with the service here.\u00a0\n\nGoogle also launches a way to test the privacy of A.I. models.\u00a0Google has released a privacy testing library for Tensorflow, its popular deep learning programming language. It will allow those who use Tensorflow Privacy, a toolkit for privacy-preserving machine learning that Google debuted last year, to test how well various A.I. classifiers maintain data privacy, according to Venture Beat.\u00a0\n\nDidi Chuxing says it will have one million self-driving taxis by 2030. The Chinese company, which runs a ride sharing service similar to Uber, tells the BBC that it plans to have one million driverless taxis operating on public roads by 2030. But, as the BBC story points out, industry watchers have become skeptical of such bold predictions after many other self-driving taxi services are behind on, or have already missed, deadlines for putting large numbers of autonomous vehicles on the road.\n\nEYE ON A.I. TALENT\n\nSamsung Electronics has promoted\u00a0Sebastian Seung\u00a0to head its Samsung Research division, ZDNet reported. Seung, a Princeton University computer scientist specializing in A.I. and neuroscience, has helped lead Samsung\u2019s A.I. research efforts since joining the company in 2018. He will now oversee all of the company\u2019s 15 global R&D hubs and seven A.I. research centers.\n\nMongoDB, the database platform company based in New York, has appointed Mark Porter as chief technology officer, the company said in a press release. Porter was previously CTO at Grab, the high-flying Southeast Asian startup that provides services ranging from food delivery to ride hailing to mobile payments. Porter joined MongoDB\u2019s board as a director in February, but will step down to assume his new role, the company said.\n\nHealx,\u00a0a Cambridge, England-based startup that uses A.I. to accelerate drug discovery for rare diseases, has hired\u00a0Meri Williams to be its\u00a0chief technology officer, according to trade publication BusinessCloud. Williams had previously been the CTO at U.K. challenger bank Monzo.\n\nOne Stop Systems Inc.\u00a0has appointed\u00a0David Raun\u00a0as its\u00a0president and chief executive officer, the company said in a press release. Raun had been in the role on an interim basis since February and had previously been president and chief operating officer at Assia, a Silicon Valley-based SaaS software company. The Escondido, California-based One Stop Systems makes high-performance computer systems used for machine learning in the defense sector, ffinance and entertainment industries, and research scientists.\n\nEYE ON A.I. RESEARCH\n\nDeepMind expands its robot control software suite.\u00a0The London-based A.I. research company, owned by Google parent Alphabet, has open-sourced its latest library of tools for training complex virtual robots in the physics simulator MuJoCo using reinforcement learning. The library includes a number of sophisticated pre-trained robots, including a \u201cPhaero Dog\u201d model, as well as a framework for training a wide range of new kinds of animated creatures. Interestingly, the pre-trained models also include a highly-complex \u201cRodent\u201d model which the DeepMind researchers say may help biologists and other scientists do virtual experiments that might provide insights into how real rodents think and behave. Training virtual robots in these simulated environments is thought to be an important step towards deploying more complex real robots in real life.\n\nDrone imagery helps count refugees. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the University of Kentucky, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have create a dataset designed to train an algorithm to estimate the refugee populations based on overhead images. The training set consists of drone-gathered images of 34 different refugee camps in Bangladesh. In a paper published on research repository Arxiv.org, the scientists say that, so far, a model trained on the dataset has been able to estimate refugee populations with a mean estimation error of 7%, which the researchers imply may need to be improved further to be truly useful in real world settings. Nevertheless, the researchers say their work is \u201can important step\u201d towards creating tools that will help humanitarian groups respond faster and more effectively to refugee and other humanitarian crises.\n\nFORTUNE ON A.I.\n\nAccenture\u2019s CEO: 5 rules for rethinking digital transformation during COVID-19\u2014by Julie Sweet\n\nNew bill would bar federal agencies from using facial-recognition technology\u2014by Jonathan Vanian\n\nHow a Bill Gates-backed startup plans to save farming with A.I.\u2014by Aaron Pressman\n\nIBM\u2019s Ginni Rometty: The way we hire must change\u2014and we must do it now\u2014Michal Lev-Ram\n\nAlgorithms won\u2019t end racism\u2014they\u2019re making it worse\u2014by Clay Chandler and Eamon Barrett\n\nThese big businesses are all boycotting Facebook ads\u2014by Danielle Abril\n\nBRAIN FOOD\nYann LeCun\u2019s telling missteps on A.I. bias\n\nYann LeCun is one of the world\u2019s best-known machine learning researchers. He\u2019s the pioneer of convolutional neural networks, a Turing Award winner, a distinguished New York University professor and Facebook\u2019s Chief A.I. Scientist. But this past week, LeCun demonstrated a major blindspot when it comes to thinking about A.I. bias\u2014as well as how to engage in a constructive dialogue about racial injustice.\n\nLeCun\u2019s trouble started when he responded to the controversy surrounding PULSE, a computer vision model created by researchers at Duke University that claimed to be able to take pixelated, low-quality images and smoothly \u201cupscale\u201d them into high-resolution images. The problem was, as my colleague Jonathan Vanian reported last week, when PULSE was fed a pixelated image that most of the world would have easily recognized as a fuzzy headshot of former President Barack Obama, it converted his face into that of a white man. Similar problems occurred when PULSE was fed pixelated images of other well-known nonwhite people, including Mohammed Ali, Samuel L. Jackson and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When an A.I. researcher tweeted that this was a great example of the problem of bias in algorithms, LeCun replied that \u201cML systems are biased when data is biased.\u201d He also claimed that the consequences of bias were more of an issue for machine learning being deployed in commercial settings than for A.I. researchers.\u00a0\n\nThis drew the ire of Timnit Gebru, a researcher who co-leads Google\u2019s Ethical A.I. team. Gebru is well-known for her work on racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems and other algorithms. She is also a co-founder of the group Black in A.I., which has pushed for better representation of Black people in the field of A.I. research. She tweeted that issues around biased A.I. could not simply be reduced to biased data\u2014and that LeCun should essentially know better.\n\nAt first, LeCun did not engage with Gebru\u2014even though he did respond to other, white researchers, which further inflamed the situation. Then he did reply to her in a long series of tweets, but said \u201cpeople like us\u201d should respond in a \u201cnon-emotional and rational manner.\u201d At this point, Gebru said that she was refusing to engage further for the sake of her own sanity. Other computer scientists jumped in, one suggesting LeCun read Gebru\u2019s published research (LeCun said, \u201cI know this paper\u201d) and one accusing him of \u201cgaslighting Black women and dismissing tons of scholarly work.\u201d LeCun posted to his Facebook page his endorsement of an anonymous Twitter user who worried \u201cthe argumentative norms of the social justice movement are eroding the ability for people to actually debate ideas.\u201d\n\nEventually, Facebook\u2019s head of A.I., Jerome Pesenti, intervened to apologize \u201cfor how this situation has escalated.\u201d He said Facebook AI Research (which LeCun founded seven years ago) valued Gebru\u2019s \u201ctrailblazing work and that of the broader AI community focused on issues of bias and race in AI and this is not how we want to show up in these conversations.\u201d Meanwhile LeCun, on Monday, announced he was abandoning Twitter forever. This lead to more outraged tweets from LeCun\u2019s supporters, who also pleaded with him to reconsider his decision, while his detractors accused LeCun of trying to seize the mantle of victimhood from Gebru, who he had arguably victimized, and who, unlike LeCun, is a member of a historically-victimized racial minority.\u00a0\n\nWell, at least Pesenti recognized how bad this was all looking for Facebook. And, as VentureBeat\u2019s A.I. reporter Khari Johnson makes clear in a well-written and pointed take on this whole episode (you can read the whole thing here), it comes at a time when Facebook is facing a growing advertiser boycott over its unwillingness to do more to police hate speech as well as mounting concerns over its lack of employee diversity. (As Johnson points out, the two problems are likely closely interlinked.)\n\nI won\u2019t further pile on LeCun or Facebook here, but I will re-emphasize the points Gebru was making because they are critical for any organization thinking about deploying A.I. There is a worrying tendency among both A.I. researchers and companies pushing A.I. software to look for \u201csilver bullet\u201d solutions to these problems. I see researchers publishing papers on ways to automatically detect\u2014and then supposedly automatically correct\u2014bias in datasets, or advancing mathematical techniques for determining that an algorithm\u2019s output is fair. At best, these tools are only part of the solution. At worst, they lead to complacency, false confidence and an abdication of moral and ethical responsibility.\u00a0\n\nAs Gebru sought to highlight, fairness is about more than just biased inputs to A.I. systems or even biased outputs\u2014it is also about biased outcomes. It has to do with why a business wants to use the algorithm in the first place\u2014what is its purpose and intent\u2014as well as how exactly that tool is being used. The scientists and engineers developing A.I. systems and the business executives deploying them must not be allowed to elide moral and ethical responsibility by shrugging and saying, well, we ran a test and found the data wasn\u2019t biased.\n\nEnsuring ethical outcomes requires critical thinking, values and judgment. There is no algorithm for that.\u00a0\n\nMost Popular\nWhen does the extra $600 in federal unemployment end?

Every Learning And Development Leader Should Know\nMursal HedayatContributor\nEntrepreneurs\nI cover topics on EdTech and impactful entrepreneurship.\n\nThe future of the office is up in the air. With millions of workers now getting a taste for working from home, it's unclear whether many will return. Spending less time commuting, more time with the family, and increasing personal productivity are just a handful of the remote working benefits driving a potential long-term change.\n\nBusiness leaders, HR and learning and development professionals have a challenging new context to contend with. The shift to remote working represents an opportunity to enhance workforce development and the up-skilling of employees by leveraging the power of digital learning. And the good news is that there's a wealth of pioneering technology providers that are helping in this space. Here's a handpicked selection:\n\nInsideOut \u00a0\n\nInsideOut is a workplace wellness movement that is leading the change in improving mental health care in the workplace. The platform matches users with curated content and experienced therapists based on individual needs, providing a safe space for employees to talk about their mental health. In turn, employers can gain a detailed understanding of the mental health landscape of their organisations through anonymous surveying, and set up initiatives to keep mental health a high priority.\u00a0\n\nHow InsideOut Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nWorking from home is not rosy for everyone. Work-life balance can be negatively impacted for some, and feelings of isolation and disconnect can intensify. InsideOut ensures workers can speak up and receive the support they need. Having mental health care as a crucial part of your employee assistance plans can improve performance and productivity while also reducing absenteeism.\n\nUptale\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUptale is an immersive learning platform designed for businesses to create, share and track training modules in 360\u00b0 photos or videos and virtual reality. Weaving together technology, theoretical content, and practical exercises can create endless training environments.

Tailored mentoring and coaching programmes also help to improve Diversity & Inclusion, Women in Leadership, High-Potentials and more.\u00a0\n\nHow Guider Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nAs companies come to terms with remote working being the norm, it\u2019s still important to have different parts of an organisations talking, helping and ideating with each other. For junior employees, in particular, mentoring is an essential part of development. And for future company leaders, coaching and mentoring is a crucial way to develop effective management skills. Remote working needn't eradicate this time-old business practice.\u00a0\n\nChatterbox\n\nChatterbox is an online language learning platform that gives employees the tools to develop cultural intelligence while positively changing the world.

Online language training is now centre stage. Chatterbox offers a personalised, adaptive learning experience based on learners' proficiency and goals, while also benefiting one of the most vulnerable groups of people in our global society thanks to our digitally connected world.\n\nPaddle\n\nPaddle is an AI-powered talent mobility and career growth platform built to retain, engage, and inspire talent. Powered by over 440 million peoples' skills, Paddle's Talent Marketplace enables users to quickly staff up projects with employees who already have the skills companies need.\n\nHow Paddle Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nIt's never been more critical to create a working environment that encourages internal talent and innovation.
