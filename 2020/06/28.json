You\u2019ll likely find surprising insights that apply to your life and work.\u00a0\n\nIn this piece, I\u2019m highlighting a couple themes that I think are universally relevant.\u00a0 I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nGETTY\n\nYou Don\u2019t Decide Anymore\n\nMost Popular In: Enterprise & Cloud\nIs Work-From-Home Productivity A Mirage?\nThe Most Innovative Companies Of 2020 According To BCG\nThe Future Of Work Now: The Computer-Assisted Translator And Lilt\n\nJust a few years ago, I wrote about the automation of decision making in our daily shopping decisions.\u00a0 I asked: \u201cwhat if our weekly groceries were delivered to us automatically based on the information we\u2019re willing to share with retailers about our schedule, eating habits and preferences?\u201d\u00a0 After all, we\u2019re used to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) recommending movies based on our viewing habits.\u00a0 What if that extended to our physical world?!\n\nIn this year\u2019s predictions, Gartner implies that we might be getting closer to that reality: \u201cby 2025, the top 10 retailers globally will leverage AI to facilitate prescriptive product recommendations, transactions and forward deployment of inventory for immediate delivery to consumers\u201d.\n\nThe idea that Artificial Intelligence (AI) might not only aid our decision making process but that it would in fact enact decisions on our behalf might be scary for some.\u00a0 However, countless examples of this trend are already present in our daily lives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI feel so strongly about this truth that, just a few months ago, I told a reporter that \u201cA.I.\u201d (the acronym used for \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d) should also be used to describe the benefits we get from Artificial Intelligence: \u201cA.I. doesn\u2019t just stand for \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d. It also stands for \u201cApplied and Invisible\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0 Try this simple exercise:\u00a0\n\nPick up your phone and start a text\nType a sentence but don\u2019t insert spaces within words (for example: \u2018whatdoyou\u2019)\nHit the spacebar.\n\nNotice how your phone inserted spaces in the correct places?\u00a0 Your phone detected your error and corrected it as you typed.\u00a0 It decided for you.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis occurs around us every day.\u00a0 Multiple times a day.\u00a0 Almost invisibly.\u00a0 In plain sight.\u00a0 And it\u2019s just the beginning.\u00a0 According to Gartner: \u201cBy 2024, 80% of newly created documents and correspondence will contain recycled content and content inserted through autocompletion\u201d\n\nThere is a massive difference between a phone completing your texts and a retailer automatically delivering goods to your doorstep.\u00a0 However, my simple autocompletion example points to what I believe are important vectors for AI value realization: Application and Invisibility.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is most useful when it is \u201cApplied\u201d and \u201cInvisible\u201d. And humans make choices (sometimes unconsciously) to accept AI into their life based on the value and the risk they perceive the service provides.\n\nThe Future\n\nGETTY\n\nBack to my retail example.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever used Zappos, you might have benefited from their return policy: customers can easily order multiple shoe sizes or types and return what they don\u2019t like for free.\u00a0 When I asked Zappos founder (who happens to live in my neighborhood) what was hard about starting his company, he pointed to the fact that, when he started it (over 20 years ago), investors didn\u2019t believe that customers would behave that way.\u00a0 As it turns out, they did.\u00a0 That model worked so well that 10 years later, Zappos sold to Amazon for close to $1B.\n\nThe company seems to have worked out a pretty successful business model despite what investors believed would be tough barriers to overcome: the cost of shipping physical goods and consumers' habits.\n\nWhat if Zappos now sent you shoes based on what it knows about your habits? Would you find that intrusive or would you elect to pay for such a service?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs it turns out, such a service already exists and many are already paying for it.\u00a0 Take a look at Stitch Fix (NASDAQ: SFIX), an online personal styling subscription service that uses recommendation algorithms and data science to decide what clothing items to deliver to you based on size, budget and style. The company went public 3 years ago, has a valuation north of $2B and has a business model that predicated on the idea that algorithms can choose for you.\u00a0 The future is already here but not everyone is aware of it. Yet.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nWhen assessing technology like Artificial Intelligence, focus on how \u201cinvisibly applicable\u201d it is (or will be).\u00a0 Focus on how effortlessly and conveniently value is delivered.\u00a0 Businesses that thrive on using A.I. don\u2019t do so because of the predictions of investors (see Zappos\u2019 example).\u00a0 They succeed because consumers choose to evolve habits based on the value that technology brings to their lives.\u00a0 Value is best realized when it is applied to a specific problem and it is experienced effortlessly or invisibly (see the phone auto-correct example above).\u00a0 Finally, by the time you predict a technology trend, it might already be there (see StitchFix story above): don\u2019t miss the technology trends that are hidden in plain sight.\n\nOne More Thing\n\nIf the above feels too scary, rest assured: massive change won\u2019t occur as abruptly as you might fear. Indeed, Gartner predicts that despite the fact that \u201caugmented analytics technology will be ubiquitous\u201d by 2022, \u201conly 10% of analysts will use its full potential\u201d.\n\nAnd the research firm goes on to explain that, through next year, \u201c80% of line of business (LOB) leaders will override business decisions made by AI\u201d.\n\nThe reality though is that change is coming and that it will ultimately change the way we live and work.\u00a0 According to Gartner, \u201c69% of what a manager currently does will be automated by 2024, requiring a complete overhaul of the role of the manager\u201d.\n\nFor more insights like the above, join me every Monday as I discuss the top Data, AI and Analytics trends of the week on youtube, spotify and medium.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\u00a0\nBruno Aziza\n\nBruno Aziza is a technology entrepreneur.

With events like Covid-19, there is increased focus on solutions that tap into the extraordinary capabilities from AI. Something else unique is also happening. Generation Z (Gen Z) and the young millennial entrepreneurs are leading the way.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhere are these innovators starting? One area where they are tapping into is a field everyone has had high hopes over the past few decades: robotics. The robotics industry has always dreamed of robots becoming more than autonomous machines to tackle hard or tedious tasks. Consider, the cognition required in activities relating to warehouse packaging or agriculture There are some mundane things that can be done by a robot with a little intelligence. Healthcare, manufacturing, and retail face similar challenges. With the advent of AI powered robots, the Gen Z and young millennial entrepreneurs are launching startups to complete these increasingly complex physical tasks.\n\n\n\n\nfarm robots\n\nDEPOSIT PHOTOS\n\nOne such startup is Farmwise. With the onset of Covid-19, the critical importance of food and its supply chain (and the risk of having workers physically present to complete the needed tasks) is a solid opportunity for some robot help. With startups such as Farmwise, seasonal forecasting models can boost production, and robots automate much of the farming previously done by tractors. Founded in 2016, these new entrepreneurs were a group of machine learning experts from MIT, Stanford, and Columbia. They created robots that can weed a field of crops large enough to feed 400,000 people per robot. Thomas Palomares, the CTO, describes the challenge of attacking agriculture with AI as \u201ccombining multiple domains of expertise such as machine learning, robotics, and mechanical engineering.\u201d Farmwise leverages machine learning when a robot searches for the center of each crop, a prerequisite for high-precision weeding. Through this identification, the robots can more efficiently remove weeds which, in turn, improves crop yields and reduced the need for chemical pesticides. It is a double win.\n\nMost Popular In: AI\nGoogle\u2019s \u201cZoom Killer\u201d Adds New Video Conferencing Features\n15 Companies That Are Saving The World From Covid-19\nAndroid Phones May Soon Show You When A Business Is Calling You - And Why\n\n\n\n\nBeyond a specific task (like pulling weeds), other AI robot startups tackle an even more general problem: how to create a general AI platform that can benefit multiple use cases in virtually any industry? Covariant, an AI startup co-founded in 2017 by AI researchers at UC Berkeley, enables robots to see and reason as independent beings. This allows the robots to adapt to any customer environment across multiple industries requiring automation of physical logistics. The Covariant team trains its robots with general, human abilities, such as 3D perception and physical object manipulation. Overall, it can handle over 10,000 different items with 99 percent accuracy and pick up these objects, even if it has never seen before. Covariant\u2019s market strategy is to expand into industries where robot automation can offload logistic challenges such as inventory management and order fulfillment in spaces such as food, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail.\n\n\n\n\nTurning to the planet, the benefit of reducing carbon pollution is a key component in the fight against climate change. One of the most effective tools discovered so far is renewable energy. Gen Z and young millennial entrepreneurs are turning to AI for assistance in improving energy efficiency, accessibility, and integration into the central energy grid. However, renewable energy is not without it is challenges. Perhaps the most prominent issue is the unpredictability of the weather. Wind and solar are the fasted growing sources of renewable energy, and both rely heavily on the weather for power generation. Although there are technological advancements to predict weather forecasting, there are still unpredictable changes in climate that can impact the flow of energy. As the demand for renewable energy continues to grow, many young entrepreneurs have focused on leveraging AI to overcome these issues and improve renewable energy productivity.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nStarted in Oakland, Powerscout has focused their efforts for accelerating the adoption of solar power for home usage. Helping to reduce costs with consumer acquisition. Powerscout uses its solar calculator to function as a Facebook Messenger chatbot to calculate solar savings estimates for its consumers. Their AI-based chatbot helps potential customers determine if installing solar panels is beneficial for their home. It also collects data (from several sources) to estimate associated installation costs of installation and the anticipated expected savings from its usage. This data not only aids the company in optimizing their existing services but also allows them to expand into new consumer markets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Assistant; Personal PA Services\n\nOLIVIER LE MOAL\n\nMillennial and Generation Z entrepreneurs are also making their impact on the \u201choly grail\u201d of AI: the digital assistant who can help us with anything.\u00a0Over the years, many digital assistant applications, like Siri and Alexa, have been useful for small tasks for like getting weather information, driving directions, event reminders, or help switching off the lights. Having been the original digital assistant, Apple\u2019s Siri is renowned for its machine learning system, which runs on algorithms to recognize and execute users\u2019 requests. Other virtual assistants, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa and the Google Assistant, have expanded to address more external capabilities, such integration with smart home technology to activate lights, air conditioning, or other electronically enabled devices on demand.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding upon this foundation of virtual assistants, many young entrepreneurs are taking innovation to the next level by leveraging AI to handle more complex tasks. One new startup, Wing AI, has utilized a hybrid of AI and human operation (a combination not often unseen in digital assistants) that can carry out any requests for its user, such as running errands, planning a three-day vacation, or ordering food. Started by recent college graduates, these entrepreneurs realized that mundane concierge were a ripe opportunity but involved a lot of complexity and variability. To handle this challenge, Wing uses AI to process a user request and employs human augmentation to recognize nuances and patterns within a request that a pure AI-based solution may not be able to identify. By combining AI and human operations, these entrepreneurs have been able to handle much more variable and complicated requests.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nClimbing the staircase of innovation\n\nRA2STUDIO\n\nMany Gen Z and young millennial entrepreneurs have unlocked new potential and innovative startups using AI. Their fresh perspective plus passion-driven goals, like social good, given them an incredible well of opportunities with AI. These young entrepreneurs are the next wave of innovation and disruption as they pioneer the growth of AI powered solutions.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website\u00a0or\u00a0some of my other work\u00a0here.\u00a0\nNeil Sahota\n\nNeil Sahota (\u8428\u51a0\u519b) is an IBM Master Inventor, United Nations (UN) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advisor, Professor at UC Irvine, and author of the book: Own the A.I.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u00a0Read More\nSite Feedback\nTips\nCorrections\nReprints & Permissions\nTerms\nPrivacy\n\u00a9 2020 Forbes Media LLC.
