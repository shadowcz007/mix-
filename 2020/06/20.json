Now researchers think they have found a way to fix this, by teaching AI about physics.\n\nTo be more specific, teaching them about the Hamiltonian function, which gives the AI information about the entirety of a dynamic system: all the energy contained within it, both kinetic and potential.\n\nNeural networks, designed to loosely mimic the human brain as a complex, carefully weighted type of AI, then have a 'bigger picture' view of what's happening, and that could open up possibilities for getting AI to tackle harder and harder problems.\n\n\"The Hamiltonian is really the special sauce that gives neural networks the ability to learn order and chaos,\" says physicist John Lindner, from North Carolina State University.\n\n\"With the Hamiltonian, the neural network understands underlying dynamics in a way that a conventional network cannot. This is a first step toward physics-savvy neural networks that could help us solve hard problems.\"\n\nThe researchers compare the introduction of the Hamiltonian function to a swinging pendulum \u2013 it's giving AI information about how fast the pendulum is swinging and its path of travel, rather than just showing AI a snapshot of the pendulum at one point in time.\n\nIf neural networks understand the Hamiltonian flow \u2013 so where the pendulum is, in this analogy, where it might be going, and the energy it has \u2013 then they are better able to manage the introduction of chaos into order, the new study found.\n\nNot only that, but they can also be built to be more efficient: better able to forecast dynamic, unpredictable outcomes without huge numbers of extra neural nodes. It helps AI to quickly get a more complete understanding of how the world actually works.\n\nA representation of the Hamiltonian flow, with rainbow colours coding a fourth dimension. (North Carolina State University)\n\nTo test their newly improved AI neural network, the researchers put it up against a commonly used benchmark called the H\u00e9non-Heiles model, initially created to model the movement of a star around a sun.\n\nThe Hamiltonian neural network successfully passed the test, correctly predicting the dynamics of the system in states of order and of chaos.\n\nThis improved AI could be used in all kinds of areas, from diagnosing medical conditions to piloting autonomous drones.\u00a0\n\nWe've already seen AI simulate space, diagnose medical problems, upgrade movies and develop new drugs, and the technology is, relatively speaking, just getting started \u2013 there's lots more on the way. These new findings should help with that.\n\n\"If chaos is a nonlinear 'super power', enabling deterministic dynamics to be practically unpredictable, then the Hamiltonian is a neural network 'secret sauce', a special ingredient that enables learning and forecasting order and chaos,\" write the researchers in their published paper.\n\nThe research has been published in Physical Review E.", "images": ["https://www.sciencealert.com/images/logo/sa-black-logo-2020.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/logo/sa-white-logo-2019.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/search.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/bar-icon_x3.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/white_arrow_right.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/homepage_share_icons/typical/facebook_x3.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/homepage_share_icons/typical/twitter_x3.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/homepage_share_icons/typical/instagram_x3.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/menubar_email.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/sciencealert_system/rss_x3.png", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2020-06/processed/GettyImages-1195715955_1_1024.jpg", "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2020-06/ai-nets-2.jpg"]}, {"img": "https://images.deepai.org/news-links/5f6471204a614f179e97f85f7cd8a043/a-closer-look-at-sagemaker-studio-aws-machine-learni.jpg", "title": "A closer look at SageMaker Studio, AWS' machine learning IDE", "url": "https://deepai.org/posts/a-closer-look-at-sagemaker-studio-aws-machine-learning-ide", "date": 1593264150.0, "origin_url": "https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/27/a-closer-look-at-sagemaker-studio-aws-machine-learning-ide/", "id": "3a57b4ce25c0597c84ab4c1325e44311", "day": "2020-06-27", "is_new": true, "zh": "\u4ed4\u7ec6\u770b\u770bSageMaker Studio\uff0cAWS\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60IDE"}, {"img": "https://images.deepai.org/news-links/12caaf7ad7244f0b85417c2a0ddde4d6/artificial-intelligence-ai-as-a-service-market-size-.jpg", "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) As a Service Market Size, Share 2020 By Development, Trend, Key ...", "url": "https://deepai.org/posts/artificial-intelligence-ai-as-a-service-market-size-share-2020-by-development-trend-key", "date": 1593167625.0, "origin_url": "https://www.cuereport.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-as-a-service-market-10377/", "id": "e0229314579ba83c90ad36b39ae3a0d1", "day": "2020-06-26", "is_new": true, "zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd \uff08AI\uff09 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u6309\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5173\u952e..."}, {"img": "https://images.deepai.org/news-links/39628615e04f476c92df67742bdf7c84/side-effects-of-testicular-cancer-predicted-by-machi.jpg", "title": "Side effects of testicular cancer predicted by machine learning", "url": "https://deepai.org/posts/side-effects-of-testicular-cancer-predicted-by-machine-learning", "date": 1593153450.0, "origin_url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-06/tuod-seo062620.php", "id": "8836b6fa5d32035c9b92695100a05eea", "day": "2020-06-26", "is_new": true, "zh": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u777e\u4e38\u764c\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528"}, {"img": "https://images.deepai.org/news-links/eb9aa21e0ad64e078b99483fa5179c7e/what-is-healthcare-training-data-why-is-it-important.jpg", "title": "What is Healthcare Training Data?

One is about translating AI networks to support clinical work in neuro diseases.\n\nThe second USyd-led project is focused on using machine learning to improve youth mental health, with the aim to ultimately shorten trial periods where some are provided with non-optimal treatments for their conditions.\n\n\"This project will use AI to test and quantify the impacts of youth mental health interventions and as a result support the development of an ethical clinical decision-support tool that identifies how to target assessment and interventions to optimise outcomes for individuals presenting for mental health care,\" Minister for Health Greg Hunt said.\n\n\"AI will be used to understand which interventions, or components of therapies provide the vital, active ingredients, and why they are more effective for some patients and not others.\"\n\nSee also: AI is helping get medical research into the hands of doctors and patients (TechRepublic)\n\nThe remaining fund of just over AU$2 million will be shared with St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research that is using AI to potentially change breast cancer screening.\n\nElsewhere, the Victorian government has made a AU$1.5 million contribution to help Boab AI and Artesian establish an accelerator and investment fund for AI scaleups.\n\n\"This funding will help to position Victoria as a leading destination for AI technology within the Asia Pacific region, attracting and developing the best talent, investment and AI expertise,\" Minister for Innovation, Medical Research and the Digital Economy Jaala Pulford said.\n\nSet to be rolled out by the end of the year, the new accelerator program will establish an AI internship program and run AI-focused events.\n\nAdditionally, the Victorian government said Artesian will invest a minimum of AU$8 million of private sector capital in 32 AI scaleups, with a minimum of AU$300,000 for each scaleup that graduates from the Boab AI program.\n\nArtesian will also establish and raise a new venture capital fund with a target of AU$50 million to provide ongoing investment support for AI scaleups.\n\nOver at Western Australia, the state government has splashed out on a new AU$1.5 million medical cardiovascular x-ray system that has been installed at the Royal Perth Hospital (RPH).\n\nThe Western Australian government said the Artis Icono system will allow cardiologists make faster decisions more accurately during critical procedures, including implants for the treatment of heart attacks, pacemaker, and other device implants used for cardiac procedures. The system is also touted to allow patients to receive accurate results faster.\n\n\"It is essential to ensure our hospitals are using modern and effective technology to complete important tests and procedures and review in a timely manner because it improves patient outcomes,\" health minister Roger Cook said.\n\n\"Royal Perth Hospital is the only site in Western Australia to have installed the Artis Icono system which will bring significant benefits to many patients across our state.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\nAI and the coronavirus fight: How artificial intelligence is taking on COVID-19\nAustralia's NIB on digitally fuelled healthcare in a post-coronavirus world\nLa Trobe University uses AI to bring mental health care to cancer patients\nMonash University researchers use AI technology to examine hospital readmissions\nHealthDirect Australia keeping tabs on directory data quality using federated platform\nRELATED TOPICS: AUSTRALIA CXO DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TECH INDUSTRYSMART CITIES CLOUD\n\nBy Aimee Chanthadavong | June 29, 2020 -- 00:46 GMT (17:46 PDT) | Topic: Innovation\n\nSHOW COMMENTS\nMORE FROM AIMEE CHANTHADAVONG\n\nData Centers\n\nLeading Edge Data Centres puts AU$20 million towards Newcastle data centre campus\n\nBanking\n\nSuncorp Group rejigs operating model to fast-track digital and data transformation\n\nE-Commerce\n\nAmazon to build its first robotic and largest fulfilment centre in Australia\n\nHardware\n\nDTA adds audio visual and smart devices to hardware marketplace panel category list\n\nNEWSLETTERS\nRELATED STORIES\n1 of 3\n\nTwo commercial satellite ground stations go live in Alice Springs\n\nFunded by Indigenous Business Australia, the development is touted as the first of its kind on Aboriginal owned land.\n\nAU$8m fleet of shark-spotting drones and drumlines for the NSW coastline\n\nThe 'shark management' strategy will include the deployment of drones at 34 beaches and 35 SMART drumlines in locations deemed as high-risk.\n\nAustralia's Consumer Data Right: Here's everything you need to know\n\nFrom July 1, customers can request their bank to share their data for deposit and transaction accounts and credit and debit cards.

You\u2019ll likely find surprising insights that apply to your life and work.\u00a0\n\nIn this piece, I\u2019m highlighting a couple themes that I think are universally relevant.\u00a0 I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nGETTY\n\nYou Don\u2019t Decide Anymore\n\nMost Popular In: Enterprise & Cloud\nIs Work-From-Home Productivity A Mirage?\nThe Most Innovative Companies Of 2020 According To BCG\nThe Future Of Work Now: The Computer-Assisted Translator And Lilt\n\nJust a few years ago, I wrote about the automation of decision making in our daily shopping decisions.\u00a0 I asked: \u201cwhat if our weekly groceries were delivered to us automatically based on the information we\u2019re willing to share with retailers about our schedule, eating habits and preferences?\u201d\u00a0 After all, we\u2019re used to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) recommending movies based on our viewing habits.\u00a0 What if that extended to our physical world?!\n\nIn this year\u2019s predictions, Gartner implies that we might be getting closer to that reality: \u201cby 2025, the top 10 retailers globally will leverage AI to facilitate prescriptive product recommendations, transactions and forward deployment of inventory for immediate delivery to consumers\u201d.\n\nThe idea that Artificial Intelligence (AI) might not only aid our decision making process but that it would in fact enact decisions on our behalf might be scary for some.\u00a0 However, countless examples of this trend are already present in our daily lives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI feel so strongly about this truth that, just a few months ago, I told a reporter that \u201cA.I.\u201d (the acronym used for \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d) should also be used to describe the benefits we get from Artificial Intelligence: \u201cA.I. doesn\u2019t just stand for \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d. It also stands for \u201cApplied and Invisible\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0 Try this simple exercise:\u00a0\n\nPick up your phone and start a text\nType a sentence but don\u2019t insert spaces within words (for example: \u2018whatdoyou\u2019)\nHit the spacebar.\n\nNotice how your phone inserted spaces in the correct places?\u00a0 Your phone detected your error and corrected it as you typed.\u00a0 It decided for you.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis occurs around us every day.\u00a0 Multiple times a day.\u00a0 Almost invisibly.\u00a0 In plain sight.\u00a0 And it\u2019s just the beginning.\u00a0 According to Gartner: \u201cBy 2024, 80% of newly created documents and correspondence will contain recycled content and content inserted through autocompletion\u201d\n\nThere is a massive difference between a phone completing your texts and a retailer automatically delivering goods to your doorstep.\u00a0 However, my simple autocompletion example points to what I believe are important vectors for AI value realization: Application and Invisibility.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is most useful when it is \u201cApplied\u201d and \u201cInvisible\u201d. And humans make choices (sometimes unconsciously) to accept AI into their life based on the value and the risk they perceive the service provides.\n\nThe Future\n\nGETTY\n\nBack to my retail example.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever used Zappos, you might have benefited from their return policy: customers can easily order multiple shoe sizes or types and return what they don\u2019t like for free.\u00a0 When I asked Zappos founder (who happens to live in my neighborhood) what was hard about starting his company, he pointed to the fact that, when he started it (over 20 years ago), investors didn\u2019t believe that customers would behave that way.\u00a0 As it turns out, they did.\u00a0 That model worked so well that 10 years later, Zappos sold to Amazon for close to $1B.\n\nThe company seems to have worked out a pretty successful business model despite what investors believed would be tough barriers to overcome: the cost of shipping physical goods and consumers' habits.\n\nWhat if Zappos now sent you shoes based on what it knows about your habits? Would you find that intrusive or would you elect to pay for such a service?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs it turns out, such a service already exists and many are already paying for it.\u00a0 Take a look at Stitch Fix (NASDAQ: SFIX), an online personal styling subscription service that uses recommendation algorithms and data science to decide what clothing items to deliver to you based on size, budget and style. The company went public 3 years ago, has a valuation north of $2B and has a business model that predicated on the idea that algorithms can choose for you.\u00a0 The future is already here but not everyone is aware of it. Yet.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nWhen assessing technology like Artificial Intelligence, focus on how \u201cinvisibly applicable\u201d it is (or will be).\u00a0 Focus on how effortlessly and conveniently value is delivered.\u00a0 Businesses that thrive on using A.I. don\u2019t do so because of the predictions of investors (see Zappos\u2019 example).\u00a0 They succeed because consumers choose to evolve habits based on the value that technology brings to their lives.\u00a0 Value is best realized when it is applied to a specific problem and it is experienced effortlessly or invisibly (see the phone auto-correct example above).\u00a0 Finally, by the time you predict a technology trend, it might already be there (see StitchFix story above): don\u2019t miss the technology trends that are hidden in plain sight.\n\nOne More Thing\n\nIf the above feels too scary, rest assured: massive change won\u2019t occur as abruptly as you might fear. Indeed, Gartner predicts that despite the fact that \u201caugmented analytics technology will be ubiquitous\u201d by 2022, \u201conly 10% of analysts will use its full potential\u201d.\n\nAnd the research firm goes on to explain that, through next year, \u201c80% of line of business (LOB) leaders will override business decisions made by AI\u201d.\n\nThe reality though is that change is coming and that it will ultimately change the way we live and work.\u00a0 According to Gartner, \u201c69% of what a manager currently does will be automated by 2024, requiring a complete overhaul of the role of the manager\u201d.\n\nFor more insights like the above, join me every Monday as I discuss the top Data, AI and Analytics trends of the week on youtube, spotify and medium.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\u00a0\nBruno Aziza\n\nBruno Aziza is a technology entrepreneur.

With events like Covid-19, there is increased focus on solutions that tap into the extraordinary capabilities from AI. Something else unique is also happening. Generation Z (Gen Z) and the young millennial entrepreneurs are leading the way.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhere are these innovators starting? One area where they are tapping into is a field everyone has had high hopes over the past few decades: robotics. The robotics industry has always dreamed of robots becoming more than autonomous machines to tackle hard or tedious tasks. Consider, the cognition required in activities relating to warehouse packaging or agriculture There are some mundane things that can be done by a robot with a little intelligence. Healthcare, manufacturing, and retail face similar challenges. With the advent of AI powered robots, the Gen Z and young millennial entrepreneurs are launching startups to complete these increasingly complex physical tasks.\n\n\n\n\nfarm robots\n\nDEPOSIT PHOTOS\n\nOne such startup is Farmwise. With the onset of Covid-19, the critical importance of food and its supply chain (and the risk of having workers physically present to complete the needed tasks) is a solid opportunity for some robot help. With startups such as Farmwise, seasonal forecasting models can boost production, and robots automate much of the farming previously done by tractors. Founded in 2016, these new entrepreneurs were a group of machine learning experts from MIT, Stanford, and Columbia. They created robots that can weed a field of crops large enough to feed 400,000 people per robot. Thomas Palomares, the CTO, describes the challenge of attacking agriculture with AI as \u201ccombining multiple domains of expertise such as machine learning, robotics, and mechanical engineering.\u201d Farmwise leverages machine learning when a robot searches for the center of each crop, a prerequisite for high-precision weeding. Through this identification, the robots can more efficiently remove weeds which, in turn, improves crop yields and reduced the need for chemical pesticides. It is a double win.\n\nMost Popular In: AI\nGoogle\u2019s \u201cZoom Killer\u201d Adds New Video Conferencing Features\n15 Companies That Are Saving The World From Covid-19\nAndroid Phones May Soon Show You When A Business Is Calling You - And Why\n\n\n\n\nBeyond a specific task (like pulling weeds), other AI robot startups tackle an even more general problem: how to create a general AI platform that can benefit multiple use cases in virtually any industry? Covariant, an AI startup co-founded in 2017 by AI researchers at UC Berkeley, enables robots to see and reason as independent beings. This allows the robots to adapt to any customer environment across multiple industries requiring automation of physical logistics. The Covariant team trains its robots with general, human abilities, such as 3D perception and physical object manipulation. Overall, it can handle over 10,000 different items with 99 percent accuracy and pick up these objects, even if it has never seen before. Covariant\u2019s market strategy is to expand into industries where robot automation can offload logistic challenges such as inventory management and order fulfillment in spaces such as food, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail.\n\n\n\n\nTurning to the planet, the benefit of reducing carbon pollution is a key component in the fight against climate change. One of the most effective tools discovered so far is renewable energy. Gen Z and young millennial entrepreneurs are turning to AI for assistance in improving energy efficiency, accessibility, and integration into the central energy grid. However, renewable energy is not without it is challenges. Perhaps the most prominent issue is the unpredictability of the weather. Wind and solar are the fasted growing sources of renewable energy, and both rely heavily on the weather for power generation. Although there are technological advancements to predict weather forecasting, there are still unpredictable changes in climate that can impact the flow of energy. As the demand for renewable energy continues to grow, many young entrepreneurs have focused on leveraging AI to overcome these issues and improve renewable energy productivity.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nStarted in Oakland, Powerscout has focused their efforts for accelerating the adoption of solar power for home usage. Helping to reduce costs with consumer acquisition. Powerscout uses its solar calculator to function as a Facebook Messenger chatbot to calculate solar savings estimates for its consumers. Their AI-based chatbot helps potential customers determine if installing solar panels is beneficial for their home. It also collects data (from several sources) to estimate associated installation costs of installation and the anticipated expected savings from its usage. This data not only aids the company in optimizing their existing services but also allows them to expand into new consumer markets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Assistant; Personal PA Services\n\nOLIVIER LE MOAL\n\nMillennial and Generation Z entrepreneurs are also making their impact on the \u201choly grail\u201d of AI: the digital assistant who can help us with anything.\u00a0Over the years, many digital assistant applications, like Siri and Alexa, have been useful for small tasks for like getting weather information, driving directions, event reminders, or help switching off the lights. Having been the original digital assistant, Apple\u2019s Siri is renowned for its machine learning system, which runs on algorithms to recognize and execute users\u2019 requests. Other virtual assistants, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa and the Google Assistant, have expanded to address more external capabilities, such integration with smart home technology to activate lights, air conditioning, or other electronically enabled devices on demand.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding upon this foundation of virtual assistants, many young entrepreneurs are taking innovation to the next level by leveraging AI to handle more complex tasks. One new startup, Wing AI, has utilized a hybrid of AI and human operation (a combination not often unseen in digital assistants) that can carry out any requests for its user, such as running errands, planning a three-day vacation, or ordering food. Started by recent college graduates, these entrepreneurs realized that mundane concierge were a ripe opportunity but involved a lot of complexity and variability. To handle this challenge, Wing uses AI to process a user request and employs human augmentation to recognize nuances and patterns within a request that a pure AI-based solution may not be able to identify. By combining AI and human operations, these entrepreneurs have been able to handle much more variable and complicated requests.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nClimbing the staircase of innovation\n\nRA2STUDIO\n\nMany Gen Z and young millennial entrepreneurs have unlocked new potential and innovative startups using AI. Their fresh perspective plus passion-driven goals, like social good, given them an incredible well of opportunities with AI. These young entrepreneurs are the next wave of innovation and disruption as they pioneer the growth of AI powered solutions.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website\u00a0or\u00a0some of my other work\u00a0here.\u00a0\nNeil Sahota\n\nNeil Sahota (\u8428\u51a0\u519b) is an IBM Master Inventor, United Nations (UN) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advisor, Professor at UC Irvine, and author of the book: Own the A.I.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u00a0Read More\nSite Feedback\nTips\nCorrections\nReprints & Permissions\nTerms\nPrivacy\n\u00a9 2020 Forbes Media LLC.

As you develop and deliver those new features, you engage more users and collect even more data!\n\nThere\u2019s tremendous value in that data, but limited thinking may be limiting your ability to mine it for the insights you need to further improve your product or even develop new ones that better meet the needs of your user base. Perhaps you\u2019ve only gotten as far as creating simple plots and histograms around events, fault detection and other simple rules-based alerting and reporting. You know there\u2019s so much more you can do with all that data \u2014 but how?\n\nThe good news is that advanced machine learning techniques are helping organizations unlock value from user data that, until recently, yielded only limited insights. Here are five actionable steps to take to nurture a data science culture and derive more value from your data:\n\nStep 1: Embrace intellectual humility\n\nYou can\u2019t get out of basic mode if you don\u2019t embrace the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d \u2014 the often-cited Donald Rumsfeld quote on not knowing what you don\u2019t know. In other words, it\u2019s OK to not know everything. Acknowledge that you don\u2019t know everything, and trust that the data can help you figure out what might be of value.\n\nIn the age of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and easy access to powerful computing resources, there\u2019s no need to place artificial limits because of one\u2019s bias. This bias can lead to non-representative datasets, poorly engineered features and/or algorithmic outputs that can produce highly misleading, sometimes catastrophic results.\n\nStep 2: Learn from experts to develop a sound strategy\u00a0\n\nA typical engineering organization is not designed nor adept at data science; rather, it\u2019s built for creating and executing on product roadmaps. By contrast, data science involves research and experimentation. Key aspects of a sound strategy include:\n\nData collection, acquisition and roadmap creation\u00a0\nMachine learning training pipeline\u00a0\nTesting and verification methodologies\u00a0\nA model roadmap\nA resourcing plan\n\nLeading these activities requires a specialized skill set beyond product management, and you may need to leverage third-party expertise. They understand best practices and have real-world experience in solving data science challenges \u2014 and they can minimize risk and frustration.\u00a0\n\nOnce you have an understanding of the dos and don\u2019ts, you can decide whether or not to continue with third-party expertise or start bringing the skill sets in-house. You may want to leverage your trusted partner for interviewing the lead data scientist and the first few hires.\n\nStep 3: Embrace experimentation\n\nOur ability to collect all kinds of data, coupled with advances in machine learning and the availability of powerful computing resources, creates a perfect storm for advanced data modeling. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques are being used with increasing frequency to help provide interesting insights and foresight.\u00a0\n\nImagine a scenario in which you have no idea what your dataset is good for. A machine learning engineer can experiment with using various hierarchical clustering techniques to see if any interesting patterns emerge. Once they uncover patterns, they can use the clusters to develop supervised learning models and make predictions based on labeled data within the clusters. This can be done with no previous knowledge or hypothesis about the dataset\u2019s potential value.\u00a0\n\nIf the results are not satisfactory, you can either continue to refine the models and/or figure out what gaps you might have in your datasets that are yielding these results \u2014 a \u201cdata gap\u201d analysis, if you will. This can help you augment your data acquisition strategy and create better training datasets through an iterative process that leads to better model accuracy over time.\u00a0\n\nStep 4: Adopt 'productization' as a forcing function\n\nAs your confidence grows around your \u201cexperiment,\u201d you can begin to move the proofs-of-concept into engineering mode. Consider \u201cproductizing\u201d your project for either an internal or external customer to encourage getting out of research mode and ultimately help make meaningful decisions that drive quality, velocity or quantifiable business metrics such as revenue, ROI or IRR hurdle rates.\n\nSome examples of productized models can include:\n\nIntegration into the current (internal) workflow\nIntegration into an internal-facing tool that is used for decision making\nIntegration of the model into an external-facing tool or product sold to customers\n\nProductization involves features development, which requires quality assurance (QA), A/B testing, support, bug fixes and so on. Consider developing a holistic productization strategy and roadmap to align teams across the organization and encourage support for the project.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that model testing can be difficult and requires a special skill set beyond the stereotypical product QA engineers. The simplest method is a black-box approach in which QA engineers use datasets that the models were not trained on to check the input-to-output space mapping; that is, given these particular never-seen input datasets, how accurate is the output?\n\nStep 5: Think long-term\n\nJust as it is with developing new products, developing a new machine learning model that delivers increasingly meaningful insights and foresight from your data requires ongoing refinement; it is an iterative process where a combination of improving datasets along with algorithmic and model refinements can lead to very satisfactory performance.\n\nData science can be a powerful and transformative arsenal to your business. A culture that supports the experimenting nature of data scientists is not easy for many organizations to embrace and support. Having a longer-term vision, developing an understanding and being purposeful on the strategy can have a significant impact on decision-making velocity and quality and provide significant competitive advantage.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Coupled with algorithms that interpret how the radiowaves reflect off secondary objects, the radar can interpret moving objects that are out of human view.\n\nIt kinda works like those SONAR systems they used to search for the Loch Ness monster (she\u2019s real ok).\n\n[Read: McDonald\u2019s will add EV chargers to hundreds of its UK restaurants \u2014 and I\u2019m lovin\u2019 it]\n\nCredit: Princeton University Engineering\nOn the radar screen (left) there is an object (orange squares) approaching from the left. The regular camera view shows that they are obscured by some commercial buildings.\nCredit: Princeton University Engineering\nThe cyclist is now visible to the regular camera (and the driver), the orange blocks are now also plainly visible. The cyclist was tracked as they rode out from behind the containers.\n\n\u201cThis will enable cars to see occluded objects that today\u2019s LiDAR and camera sensors cannot record, for example, allowing a self-driving vehicle to see around a dangerous intersection\u201d said Researcher and Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Felix Heide.\n\nAt the moment, the system is only capable of sensing cyclists and pedestrians, but researchers say it could be developed to detect moving cars too.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the sensors are quite cheap when compared to the likes of LiDAR, so it could be introduced to a whole host of cars and scale as a system quite quickly.\n\nCredit: Princeton University Computer Imaging Lab\nMercedes-Benz appear to have provided the vehicles for testing the new radar systems. Will we see this on the next generation of vehicles? Who knows\u2026 but the researchers think so.\nTNW Couch Conferences\n\nJoin industry leaders to define new strategies for an uncertain future\n\nREGISTER NOW\n\nInterestingly, the academic paper accompanying the news has Nicolas Schiener of Mercedes-Benz AG listed as a co-author. It seems that the German automaker provided the vehicles for testing and developing the technology. There\u2019s no mention if Mercs of the future will be the first to get this tech, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out. Mercedes-Benz has a long history in its S-class of using futuristic tech for safety, such as night vision cameras.\n\nIt seems this sensor arrangement will be used like blind spot warning systems that alert drivers when there is a potential hazard approaching from somewhere that they can\u2019t see. Thinking of it this way, it\u2019s totally realistic to believe that this could soon be an additional safety feature on cars of tomorrow.\n\nCelebrate Pride 2020 with us this month!\n\nWhy is queer representation so important?

(Fred Hutch Photo)\n\nUpdated with Fred Hutch confirmation and additional details.\n\nSeattle\u2019s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is cutting more than 70 jobs, about 2% of its workforce of more than 3,000 people, GeekWire has learned.\n\nIn internal messages about the job cuts, Fred Hutch officials cite the impact of the economic downturn on the research institution\u2019s budget. The layoffs are in non-scientific positions, reducing the implications for its core research initiatives.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday morning, following this report, Fred Hutch confirmed that it is making 76 layoffs from its South Lake Union campus, and also eliminating 81 open positions.\n\n\u201cThe layoffs come after a series of cost-cutting measures implemented since March,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThese latest steps are intended to reduce a projected revenue shortfall of nearly $50 million over the next 12 months due to increased volatility in variable revenue sources including philanthropy and investment income. Although the percentage of impacted positions is less than 5% of the center\u2019s overall workforce, the layoffs are all from the center\u2019s Administrative Division.\u201d\n\nThose prior cost-cutting initiatives included limiting spending on consultants and vendors, restricting hiring, eliminating salary increases for the upcoming fiscal year, and reducing executive salaries by 5%, Fred Hutch said in the statement. Executives also waived variable compensation representing up to 20% of their 2020 base salaries.\n\nDr. Thomas Lynch has been president of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center since February. (Fred Hutch Photo)\n\n\u201cThese are already exceptionally difficult times, and these layoffs add to the pain and deep sense of loss, especially for those colleagues who are leaving us today,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Lynch, the Fred Hutch president, in an email message to employees. (Full message below.)\n\nFred Hutch\u00a0reported operating revenues of $714 million in its 2019 fiscal year, 56% of which came from contracts and government grants, 16 percent from gifts and philanthropic grants, and 6 percent from investment income. The 44-year-old organization is ranked first in National Institutes of Health funding among all U.S. independent research centers.\n\nThe institution is a life sciences and biotech powerhouse in the Seattle region, spinning off numerous startups and providing the scientific underpinnings for major companies including Adaptive Biotechnologies and Juno Therapeutics.\n\nIn addition to Fred Hutch\u2019s core cancer research initiatives, scientists in its Infectious Disease Division have emerged as leaders in the effort to understand, track and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the midst of the global pandemic.\n\nLynch, a cancer research veteran, joined Fred Hutch five months ago as its new president and director. Fred Hutch last week named a new board chair and made other changes in its board of trustees. The changes coincide with the June 30 end of the institution\u2019s 2020 fiscal year.\n\nSeparately, Fred Hutch laid off 14 people as part of a broader restructuring of its internal data science initiatives in March, but said that decision was in the works for a few months and was unrelated to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe layoffs being announced today are on a scale similar to the cuts made by Fred Hutch in April 2009, as the economic impact of the recession took hold.\n\nHere is the full text of Lynch\u2019s message to Fred Hutch employees.\n\nToday marks a difficult day for our Fred Hutch community.\n\nAs you know, Fred Hutch is not immune to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s financial impacts. Despite our centerwide efforts to reduce expenses, we were not able to fully cover a projected revenue shortfall of nearly $50 million. In order to sustain our pursuit of cures for cancer and viral diseases, today we notified 76 employees that they are being laid off. We are also eliminating 81 open positions.\n\nThese are already exceptionally difficult times, and these layoffs add to the pain and deep sense of loss, especially for those colleagues who are leaving us today.\n\nAlthough the effects of these steps will be felt by everyone in the organization, the layoffs and eliminated positions are all in our Administrative Division. All the affected roles are funded not by direct grant support but by other revenue streams, including Facilities & Administrative revenue from grants, philanthropy and investment income. These revenue sources are being affected by the economic downturn related to COVID-19, and they remain uncertain as long as the volatility continues.\n\nWe made the extremely difficult decision to implement layoffs only after enacting a series of other cost-saving measures and thoroughly evaluating a range of additional options. Our approach to budget planning throughout this pandemic has centered on supporting Fred Hutch research using the resources we have in the most efficient way. The steps we have taken, including today\u2019s reduction in staffing, are all aimed at preserving the strength of our science and our ability to fulfill our mission far into the future.\n\nEvery employee laid off today will receive a transition package that includes severance pay, health benefit continuation for those who use our benefits, and a number of other services including job-search support. We will also ensure that any qualified and affected employees who are interested in roles that open at the center in the future are interviewed for those positions.\n\nTo those who are leaving, we are grateful for your passion, dedication, and everything you have contributed to our Hutch community and our mission. You are our colleagues and friends, and you will be missed.\n\nIn my short time here, I\u2019ve been struck by the deep care and concern Hutch employees have for one another. I know you will continue to support each other.\n\nAs difficult as these decisions are, our intent is to ensure that the Hutch rebounds swiftly when the economic situation improves, and we will continue to advance the center\u2019s lifesaving work even as we confront the losses and navigate the challenges presented by this global crisis.\n\nI remain committed to keeping you informed and will devote our town hall this afternoon to discussing today\u2019s news and taking your questions.\n\nThank you again for your compassion, hard work and commitment to the Hutch\u2019s science, our community and our mission.\n\n\t\nTodd Bishop\u00a0is GeekWire's co-founder and editor, a longtime business and technology journalist who covers topics including Amazon, Microsoft, startups, AI, the cloud and health tech, and hosts GeekWire's weekly podcast.

JUN 30 202011:23 AM EDTUPDATED TUE, JUN 30 202011:29 AM EDT\nSam Shead\n@SAM_L_SHEAD\nKEY POINTS\nArtificial intelligence expert Ferenc Husz\u00e1r is set to leave his full-time role at Twitter and join the University of Cambridge.\nHusz\u00e1r was one of the first employees at London-based machine learning start-up Magic Pony, which was acquired by Twitter for a reported $150 million in 2016.\u00a0\nSocial media apps displayed on a smartphone.\nFabian Sommer | picture alliance | Getty Images\n\nArtificial intelligence expert Ferenc Husz\u00e1r is set to leave his full-time role at Twitter and join the University of Cambridge.\n\nHis departure comes four years after the micro-blogging platform acquired the London start-up he worked at, Magic Pony, for a reported $150 million.\n\nHusz\u00e1r, who is a senior machine learning engineer at Twitter's London office, is joining Cambridge's Department of Computer Science and Technology, where he completed a PhD in 2012.\u00a0\n\n\"I can confirm that I'm taking up a role at Cambridge,\"\u00a0Husz\u00e1r told CNBC via email. \"This also means that I will not indeed be full-time employed by Twitter,\" he added. \"I will miss the team and company very much.\"\n\nHusz\u00e1r, who was one of the first employees at Magic Pony, is expected to start at Cambridge on July 7.\u00a0\n\nThe university said Husz\u00e1r has an \"outstanding academic record and is a highly creative researcher with broad interests in many areas of machine learning.\"\u00a0\n\nThe move is a relatively rare example of an AI specialist moving from a big tech company to academia. Indeed, it normally happens the other way round.\u00a0\n\nIn recent years, U.S. tech giants have used large salaries to lure top professors away from universities around the world, leading to concerns of an academic brain drain.\u00a0\n\nSome AI researchers at Elon Musk's OpenAI are on salaries in excess of $1 million, according to The New York Times.\u00a0\n\nVideo compression\n\nMagic Pony developed technology to improve the quality of compressed videos so they may be enjoyed at higher quality when limited bandwidth is available. The software complemented existing compression technology but it didn't substitute it.\u00a0\n\nAt the time of the acquisition,\u00a0Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said\u00a0Magic Pony's technology would be used to boost live and video offerings and that the company's technology \"opens up a whole lot of exciting creative possibilities for Twitter.\"\n\nAt Cambridge, Husz\u00e1r will work alongside Professor Neil Lawrence, who left his job at director of machine learning role at Amazon last year to take up a role at the centuries-old university that is funded by Alphabet-owned AI lab DeepMind.\n\n\"We're very excited to welcome Ferenc to Cambridge,\" Lawrence told CNBC. \"He is a rare example of an individual who has deep insight into the theory of machine learning algorithms as well as practical experience of deploying these algorithms at scale.\"\n\n\"This mix of understanding is vital to ensure academic machine learning continues to be driven by the real challenges industry face in deploying safe, reliable, fair and interpretable machine learning.\"\n\nOther new machine learning hires at Cambridge include Carl Henrik Ek, who is joining from the University of Bristol, and Nicholas Lane who is joining from the University of Oxford.\n\nTwitter declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO\nLicensing & Reprints\nCNBC Councils\nSupply Chain Values\nCNBC on Peacock\nAdvertise With Us\nJoin the CNBC Panel\nDigital Products\nNews Releases\nClosed Captioning\nCorrections\nAbout CNBC\nInternships\nSite Map\nAd Choices\nCareers\nHelp\nContact\nNews Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

The company claims the centre will create more than 1,500 jobs, including an extra 700 jobs in construction.\n\nMore than 11 million items will be stocked at the new centre. Robots will speed up the order processing time by moving shelves to employees. They will cut down the time it takes stow items away or pick them up for new orders. The robots are also designed to save space, allowing 50% more items to be stowed per square metre.\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said in a statement the jobs come \"at a time when we need them most.\"\n\n\"Amazon\u2019s decision to locate its first robotic centre in the Southern Hemisphere right here in Western Sydney is another great example about what the future holds,\" she said.\n\nThis will be a mammoth building, with the floor area to be around 200,000 square metres across four levels \u2013 roughly the same land size of Taronga Zoo.\n\nAmazon Australia director of operations Craig Fuller said in a statement, \"The Amazon Robotics fulfilment centre will more than double our operational footprint in Australia, enhance efficiency and safety for our associates while ultimately providing customers with wider selection and faster delivery.\n\n\"This investment will also benefit the 10,000 plus small & medium sized businesses who utilise Fulfilment By Amazon to seamlessly service customers across the country.\"\n\nThere are more than 50 Amazon robotic fulfilment centres around the world\n\nAmazon has more than 175 fulfilment centres around the world and more than 50 robotics fulfilment centres.\n\nThe company expanded its automation efforts in the United States in 2019, rolling out machines to box up customer orders in a number of existing fulfilment centres. The jobs picture was less rosy there \u2013 Reuters reported that the robots were set to replace up to 1,300 jobs across 55 fulfilment centers.\n\nThe automation effort has been a long-term project, which accelerated back in 2012 when Amazon acquired robotics firm Kiva for $775 million.\n\nIn Australia, the company already has three fulfilment centres, including one in Dandenong, Melbourne, in Moorebank, Sydney and in Perth's Airport precinct. More recently, Amazon announced the development of a fourth fulfilment centre in Lytton, Brisbane which should start operating before Christmas 2020.\n\n\"The project will contribute to local workforce development and provide skilled employment in areas like robotics, logistics and supply chain,\" Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney Stuart Ayres said in a statement.\n\n\"It will also help build our local e-commerce sector, giving small and medium-sized businesses access to Amazon\u2019s packing, shipping, customer service and returns capabilities, along with easier access to millions of customers customers across Australia and the world.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated this was Amazon\u2019s fourth facility in Australia.

To get it delivered weekly to your in-box,\u00a0sign up here.\n\nA lot of A.I. companies are having a good year\u2014and that includes those who sell A.I.-enabled tech to lawyers.\n\nLast week, I spoke with Jason Brennan, the chief executive officer of U.K.-based legal A.I. company Luminance. He told me the company, which now has more than 250 customers across the globe, including a fifth of the world\u2019s largest 100 law firms, has had a 30% increase in customers since the start of 2020.\n\nLuminance has an interesting history: It was founded in 2015 by a group that included Mike Lynch, the former founder and CEO of one-time star U.K. technology company Autonomy. (Lynch is fighting extradition to the U.S. on fraud charges and is awaiting a verdict in a civil fraud suit in the U.K.) Lynch\u2019s Invoke Capital has been one of Luminance\u2019s biggest funders, but the company is also backed by venture capital firm Talis Capital and the big U.K.-based law firm Slaughter & May (which was also one of Luminance\u2019s first customers and, what's more, advised Autonomy in the merger with Hewlett-Packard that ultimately landed Lynch in legal hot water).\n\nLuminance's machine learning platform uses some elements of natural language processing, the kind of machine learning that can understand language, and some elements of clustering, a machine learning discipline focused on, as the name suggests, grouping data based on similarities and differences.\n\nClustering is one of the unsupervised learning techniques (ones that don't rely on a pre-labeled training data set) that are increasingly gaining ground in business applications. In the case of Luminance, its system uses both unsupervised learning and supervised methods\u2014while its software knows that a certain set of documents are similar, it doesn't know what they are until a human lawyer training the system applies a label to them. Once the document set is labelled, the system can learn to predict the right label for akin documents it encounters in the future.\n\nThe result is a system that can tell lawyers which documents\u2014and importantly, which clauses within documents\u2014are most similar and which are outliers.\n\nThis is important because it turns out that a lot of the \u201cgrunt work\u201d of Big Law involves doing exactly what Luminance does: combing through vast troves of documents, trying to find those clauses that might be problematic. Maybe they need to be updated due to a regulatory change. Or maybe they are part of the contracts held by a company that is being acquired and would open up a big liability issue for the buyer. Either way, law firms once deployed small armies of paralegals and junior associates to find them. It used to be that law firms could simply charge for all this labor and pass the cost on to the client. But that hasn\u2019t been true for at least a decade. These days, clients are more likely to demand law firms accept a flat fee for this sort of work, or pay based on some pre-agreed outcome, not on man hours. So firms have had to become much more efficient. Corporate in-house legal departments are also having to do more with less.\n\nThat's good for Luminance. And Brennan tells me that during the pandemic, the company has seen its customers use its A.I. in novel ways. Take the Italian law firm Portolano Cavallo and the U.K. arm of the global firm Dentons. Both firms found their clients needed to quickly determine if any contracts had force majeure clauses and exactly how they could be triggered. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea of needing to pivot very quickly to something new and unforeseen,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cForce majeure clauses have been out there forever, but the relevance of it couldn\u2019t be predicted.\u201d Using Luminance, both Dentons and Portolano were able to complete this task in record time\u2014in fact, Portolano says in a client newsletter that it was able to complete a document review that might have taken many days in just 45 minutes.\n\nBrennan says he's seen other interesting uses such as companies gaming out which creditors might be on the hook in potential bankruptcies, investigating M&A transactions as many industries brace for consolidation, and even preparing for possible class action lawsuits against the cruise line industry.\n\nLike many A.I. company CEOs, Brennan says his customers are not simply using his product to cut costs. He says A.I. is also enabling them to find new revenue streams. For instance, in the past, in big M&A transactions, the likes of the Fortune 500 would engage a big global law firm to conduct a due diligence review of contracts above a certain pre-agreed dollar value. It was simply too onerous and too expensive to look at everything. And, once a merger actually came together, the work of integrating the combined firms' contracts was often farmed out to smaller law firms, since it was too pricey to get a large one to do it, Brennan says. But now A.I. systems such as Luminance are allowing the big firms to offer comprehensive document reviews and actually retain the post-merger integration work. At the same time, they're also allowing some smaller firms to compete for work that they wouldn't have had the manpower to handle before, he says.\n\nSo, how long will it be until we have fully robotic lawyers? Well, Brennan thinks the day when software like Luminance will actually perform legal analysis\u2014assessing which clauses are most likely to trigger a legal issue, for instance\u2014is still a long way off. \u201cWe want lawyers to be lawyers,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now we are focused on highlighting information to lawyers and letting them do what they do best.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, here\u2019s the rest of this week\u2019s A.I. news.\n\nJeremy Kahn\n@Jeremyakahn\nJeremy.Kahn@fortune.com\n\nThis story has been corrected to clarify that law firm Slaughter & May represented Autonomy in its sale to Hewlett Packard but has not represented Mike Lynch personally. The spelling of Meri Williams's first name in the \"Eye on A.I. Talent\" section has also been corrected.\n\nA.I. IN THE NEWS\n\nDemocrats introduce a bill to ban facial recognition following false arrest case. A group of Democratic lawmakers have crafted a bill to ban the federal government and U.S. police departments from using facial recognition software. The bill comes in the wake of news that a Black man in Detroit had been arrested in January for a theft he did not commit after facial recognition software erroneously identified him as the person in store surveillance video of the crime. Researchers have found that many leading facial recognition algorithms are less accurate in identifying Black people and others with darker-skin. \u201cIn this moment, the only responsible thing to do is to prohibit government and law enforcement from using these surveillance mechanisms,\u201d Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said. For more on the proposed law, check out this story by my Eye on A.I. co-author Jonathan Vanian.\u00a0\n\nTrump suspends H1B visa program. Donald Trump issued an executive order temporarily suspending approvals for H1B and other work visas, Tens of thousands of skilled foreign workers, including many in the technology sector such as machine learning engineers and researchers, come to work in the U.S. each year under these programs. My Fortune colleague Grady McGregor has a story on the new policy\u2019s potential impact here. Many experts in the geopolitics of A.I. are alarmed by the move, given how reliant the U.S. is on foreign-born tech talent.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAmazon buys self-driving company Zoox.\u00a0The Everything Store is paying about $1.2 billion to acquire the startup, according to a report in\u00a0The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0Reports of a possible deal had first surfaced a month ago, also in The Journal. Amazon is thought to be interested in self-driving technologies as a way to one day automate its delivery fleet, but for now ,Zoox says Amazon will help roll out the self-driving taxi service it\u2019s been developing. Amazon has previously made minority investments in self-driving truck company Rivian Automotive and self-driving company Aurora Innovation, which also is now working on a self-driving truck. Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk used the Zoox acquisition as an opportunity to try to troll Jeff Bezos, accusing him on Twitter of being a \u201ccopy cat.\u201d It is the latest example of Musk\u2019s displeasure with Amazon, which he has called a \u201cmonopoly\u201d that should be broken up.\n\nNvidia teams up with Mercedes on A.I.-enabled cars.\u00a0The chip giant and the carmaker have signed a deal that will have Nvidia\u2019s computer chips and software installed in new Mercedes beginning in 2024, according to an Nvidia press release. The partnership will help power some existing features, such as smart cruise control and automatic lane-following-and-changing, and will also allow the cars to be upgraded over time to more and more autonomous-driving functions.\n\nGoogle launches a new A.I. image app. Google has unveiled a new A.I.-powered app called Keen. It allows users to pull together a lot of different kinds of information on theme, including Google search results and links as well as images. The app then uses machine learning to suggest similar or related information. You can read more about it and play around with the service here.\u00a0\n\nGoogle also launches a way to test the privacy of A.I. models.\u00a0Google has released a privacy testing library for Tensorflow, its popular deep learning programming language. It will allow those who use Tensorflow Privacy, a toolkit for privacy-preserving machine learning that Google debuted last year, to test how well various A.I. classifiers maintain data privacy, according to Venture Beat.\u00a0\n\nDidi Chuxing says it will have one million self-driving taxis by 2030. The Chinese company, which runs a ride sharing service similar to Uber, tells the BBC that it plans to have one million driverless taxis operating on public roads by 2030. But, as the BBC story points out, industry watchers have become skeptical of such bold predictions after many other self-driving taxi services are behind on, or have already missed, deadlines for putting large numbers of autonomous vehicles on the road.\n\nEYE ON A.I. TALENT\n\nSamsung Electronics has promoted\u00a0Sebastian Seung\u00a0to head its Samsung Research division, ZDNet reported. Seung, a Princeton University computer scientist specializing in A.I. and neuroscience, has helped lead Samsung\u2019s A.I. research efforts since joining the company in 2018. He will now oversee all of the company\u2019s 15 global R&D hubs and seven A.I. research centers.\n\nMongoDB, the database platform company based in New York, has appointed Mark Porter as chief technology officer, the company said in a press release. Porter was previously CTO at Grab, the high-flying Southeast Asian startup that provides services ranging from food delivery to ride hailing to mobile payments. Porter joined MongoDB\u2019s board as a director in February, but will step down to assume his new role, the company said.\n\nHealx,\u00a0a Cambridge, England-based startup that uses A.I. to accelerate drug discovery for rare diseases, has hired\u00a0Meri Williams to be its\u00a0chief technology officer, according to trade publication BusinessCloud. Williams had previously been the CTO at U.K. challenger bank Monzo.\n\nOne Stop Systems Inc.\u00a0has appointed\u00a0David Raun\u00a0as its\u00a0president and chief executive officer, the company said in a press release. Raun had been in the role on an interim basis since February and had previously been president and chief operating officer at Assia, a Silicon Valley-based SaaS software company. The Escondido, California-based One Stop Systems makes high-performance computer systems used for machine learning in the defense sector, ffinance and entertainment industries, and research scientists.\n\nEYE ON A.I. RESEARCH\n\nDeepMind expands its robot control software suite.\u00a0The London-based A.I. research company, owned by Google parent Alphabet, has open-sourced its latest library of tools for training complex virtual robots in the physics simulator MuJoCo using reinforcement learning. The library includes a number of sophisticated pre-trained robots, including a \u201cPhaero Dog\u201d model, as well as a framework for training a wide range of new kinds of animated creatures. Interestingly, the pre-trained models also include a highly-complex \u201cRodent\u201d model which the DeepMind researchers say may help biologists and other scientists do virtual experiments that might provide insights into how real rodents think and behave. Training virtual robots in these simulated environments is thought to be an important step towards deploying more complex real robots in real life.\n\nDrone imagery helps count refugees. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the University of Kentucky, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have create a dataset designed to train an algorithm to estimate the refugee populations based on overhead images. The training set consists of drone-gathered images of 34 different refugee camps in Bangladesh. In a paper published on research repository Arxiv.org, the scientists say that, so far, a model trained on the dataset has been able to estimate refugee populations with a mean estimation error of 7%, which the researchers imply may need to be improved further to be truly useful in real world settings. Nevertheless, the researchers say their work is \u201can important step\u201d towards creating tools that will help humanitarian groups respond faster and more effectively to refugee and other humanitarian crises.\n\nFORTUNE ON A.I.\n\nAccenture\u2019s CEO: 5 rules for rethinking digital transformation during COVID-19\u2014by Julie Sweet\n\nNew bill would bar federal agencies from using facial-recognition technology\u2014by Jonathan Vanian\n\nHow a Bill Gates-backed startup plans to save farming with A.I.\u2014by Aaron Pressman\n\nIBM\u2019s Ginni Rometty: The way we hire must change\u2014and we must do it now\u2014Michal Lev-Ram\n\nAlgorithms won\u2019t end racism\u2014they\u2019re making it worse\u2014by Clay Chandler and Eamon Barrett\n\nThese big businesses are all boycotting Facebook ads\u2014by Danielle Abril\n\nBRAIN FOOD\nYann LeCun\u2019s telling missteps on A.I. bias\n\nYann LeCun is one of the world\u2019s best-known machine learning researchers. He\u2019s the pioneer of convolutional neural networks, a Turing Award winner, a distinguished New York University professor and Facebook\u2019s Chief A.I. Scientist. But this past week, LeCun demonstrated a major blindspot when it comes to thinking about A.I. bias\u2014as well as how to engage in a constructive dialogue about racial injustice.\n\nLeCun\u2019s trouble started when he responded to the controversy surrounding PULSE, a computer vision model created by researchers at Duke University that claimed to be able to take pixelated, low-quality images and smoothly \u201cupscale\u201d them into high-resolution images. The problem was, as my colleague Jonathan Vanian reported last week, when PULSE was fed a pixelated image that most of the world would have easily recognized as a fuzzy headshot of former President Barack Obama, it converted his face into that of a white man. Similar problems occurred when PULSE was fed pixelated images of other well-known nonwhite people, including Mohammed Ali, Samuel L. Jackson and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When an A.I. researcher tweeted that this was a great example of the problem of bias in algorithms, LeCun replied that \u201cML systems are biased when data is biased.\u201d He also claimed that the consequences of bias were more of an issue for machine learning being deployed in commercial settings than for A.I. researchers.\u00a0\n\nThis drew the ire of Timnit Gebru, a researcher who co-leads Google\u2019s Ethical A.I. team. Gebru is well-known for her work on racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems and other algorithms. She is also a co-founder of the group Black in A.I., which has pushed for better representation of Black people in the field of A.I. research. She tweeted that issues around biased A.I. could not simply be reduced to biased data\u2014and that LeCun should essentially know better.\n\nAt first, LeCun did not engage with Gebru\u2014even though he did respond to other, white researchers, which further inflamed the situation. Then he did reply to her in a long series of tweets, but said \u201cpeople like us\u201d should respond in a \u201cnon-emotional and rational manner.\u201d At this point, Gebru said that she was refusing to engage further for the sake of her own sanity. Other computer scientists jumped in, one suggesting LeCun read Gebru\u2019s published research (LeCun said, \u201cI know this paper\u201d) and one accusing him of \u201cgaslighting Black women and dismissing tons of scholarly work.\u201d LeCun posted to his Facebook page his endorsement of an anonymous Twitter user who worried \u201cthe argumentative norms of the social justice movement are eroding the ability for people to actually debate ideas.\u201d\n\nEventually, Facebook\u2019s head of A.I., Jerome Pesenti, intervened to apologize \u201cfor how this situation has escalated.\u201d He said Facebook AI Research (which LeCun founded seven years ago) valued Gebru\u2019s \u201ctrailblazing work and that of the broader AI community focused on issues of bias and race in AI and this is not how we want to show up in these conversations.\u201d Meanwhile LeCun, on Monday, announced he was abandoning Twitter forever. This lead to more outraged tweets from LeCun\u2019s supporters, who also pleaded with him to reconsider his decision, while his detractors accused LeCun of trying to seize the mantle of victimhood from Gebru, who he had arguably victimized, and who, unlike LeCun, is a member of a historically-victimized racial minority.\u00a0\n\nWell, at least Pesenti recognized how bad this was all looking for Facebook. And, as VentureBeat\u2019s A.I. reporter Khari Johnson makes clear in a well-written and pointed take on this whole episode (you can read the whole thing here), it comes at a time when Facebook is facing a growing advertiser boycott over its unwillingness to do more to police hate speech as well as mounting concerns over its lack of employee diversity. (As Johnson points out, the two problems are likely closely interlinked.)\n\nI won\u2019t further pile on LeCun or Facebook here, but I will re-emphasize the points Gebru was making because they are critical for any organization thinking about deploying A.I. There is a worrying tendency among both A.I. researchers and companies pushing A.I. software to look for \u201csilver bullet\u201d solutions to these problems. I see researchers publishing papers on ways to automatically detect\u2014and then supposedly automatically correct\u2014bias in datasets, or advancing mathematical techniques for determining that an algorithm\u2019s output is fair. At best, these tools are only part of the solution. At worst, they lead to complacency, false confidence and an abdication of moral and ethical responsibility.\u00a0\n\nAs Gebru sought to highlight, fairness is about more than just biased inputs to A.I. systems or even biased outputs\u2014it is also about biased outcomes. It has to do with why a business wants to use the algorithm in the first place\u2014what is its purpose and intent\u2014as well as how exactly that tool is being used. The scientists and engineers developing A.I. systems and the business executives deploying them must not be allowed to elide moral and ethical responsibility by shrugging and saying, well, we ran a test and found the data wasn\u2019t biased.\n\nEnsuring ethical outcomes requires critical thinking, values and judgment. There is no algorithm for that.\u00a0\n\nMost Popular\nWhen does the extra $600 in federal unemployment end?

artefacts is a complicated problem for computer vision models \u00a9 AFP via Getty Images\nShare on Twitter (opens new window)\nShare on Facebook (opens new window)\nShare on LinkedIn (opens new

the labour-intensive process of inputting data from artefacts and handwritten records.\n\nThe adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is speeding up such research and drawing attention to overlooked information. But this approach, known as \u201cdigital humanities\u201d, is in a battle for funding against more future-focused applications of AI.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest in digital humanities, but there is not a lot of money,\u201d says Ilan Shimshoni, professor of computer vision and machine learning at the University of Haifa in Israel, where he works on archaeological projects that include reassembling artefacts from photos of fragments. \u201cIf you want to do an analysis of Facebook you\u2019ll get much more money than if you want to look at ancient Greek artefacts.\u201d\n\nArchaeological puzzles may not seem as urgent as computer science projects in healthcare, finance and other industries, but applying algorithmic techniques to historical research can improve AI\u2019s capabilities, says Ayellet Tal, an archaeological and computer science researcher at Israel\u2019s Technion University.\n\nRestoring or recreating archaeological artefacts is a complicated problem for computer vision models. Previous work \u2014 algorithms learning to reassemble photos or documents, for example \u2014 has not accounted for the degradation of fragments, unclear images or imprecise piece-fitting.\n\nIf you want to do an analysis of Facebook you\u2019ll get much more money than if you want to look at ancient Greek artefacts\n\nBefore attempting to reconstruct artefacts, the AI model learnt how to reverse the erosion process and predict what original fragments looked like. Researchers then defined how the model should test whether fragments fitted together.\n\n\u201cThe tasks in archaeology are classical computer vision problems,\u201d says Ms Tal. \u201cBut they are much more difficult in archaeology because the objects are not nicely behaved. We want to transform archaeology and we want to advance computer vision because these tasks are where current algorithms fail.\u201d\n\nIBM Japan and Yamagata University last year presented the first geoglyph \u2014 a large human-made ancient formation or design on the ground \u2014 identified by AI. The task required huge amounts of high resolution image data, which IBM saw as both a challenge and an opportunity to test its AI and computing capabilities.\n\n\u201cThese geoglyphs are not only spread across miles of land, but the nature of the landscape means it can be difficult to discern clues that point to new formations,\u201d says Akihisa Sakurai, an IBM engineer.\n\nDeepMind, Google\u2019s AI lab, has also targeted ancient mysteries. Yannis Assael, a DeepMind research scientist, last year published a paper with Oxford university historian Thea Sommerschield on a deep learning model called Pythia, designed to fill the gaps of missing text in ancient Greek inscriptions. In addition to developing a tool for historians, the research tackled a big challenge in AI: understanding algorithmic decision-making.\n\nBy assigning weightings to parts of the input text it used to predict missing characters, historians can better evaluate Pythia\u2019s predictions. The technique also helps improve neural networks with transparent decision-making processes in other contexts.\n\nRecommended\nSpecial ReportAI & Robotics\n\u2018Death of the office\u2019 exaggerated despite homeworking boom\n\nFor Matthew Connelly, professor of digital history and principal investigator for The History Lab, a UK data-driven research group, it is crucial that historians recognise the role that algorithms play in historical understanding.\n\nResearchers increasingly deal with digitised information as opposed to sources that have been manually curated into archives. If historians do not adapt their methods of searching and analysing sources, their theories and conclusions will be distorted, he says.\n\nFor example, physical documents can be digitised using an AI technique called optical character recognition. Even with high accuracy, letters and words are frequently misidentified or missing entirely. At a more fundamental level, historical data may mislead historians when algorithms are used to select what gets archived and what gets deleted.\n\nProf Connelly recently highlighted his concerns in a New York Times op-ed about the US State Department\u2019s practice of using machine learning to separate its documents into \u201chistoric\u201d records to be archived, and \u201ctemporary\u201d records to be deleted. Machine learning algorithms can overpredict historical significance for some documents and overlook others that will prove to be important, he warns, which he demonstrated in a project with Microsoft called \u201cPredicting History\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US government is using machine learning algorithms to destroy part of the historic record,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of history as we know it.\u201d\n\nThe US government is using machine learning algorithms to destroy part of the historic record. It\u2019s the end of history as we know it\n\nProf Connelly says his research on official secrecy can only be done with machine learning and data science techniques, and \u2014 like restoring missing text in ancient inscriptions \u2014 uses algorithms that learn to fill in the gaps.\n\nWhat gets left out of history has real-world consequences on matters of policy such as healthcare, economics and international relations. Matthew Lincoln, art historian and data research scientist, notes that this particularly affects people and groups with less power and privilege.\n\nMr Lincoln believes that machine learning is best placed to expose the gaps in historical records, but he cautions that historians must take a critical view when applying data science techniques.\n\n\u201cIf historians use machine learning naively on data generated from archival sources, it will reinforce those existing gaps,\u201d he says. \u201cPoorly-made data analyses can unwittingly lend an air of objectivity to historical arguments that really can\u2019t be supported by these incomplete archives.\u201d\n\nGet alerts on Artificial intelligence when a new story is published\n\nGet alerts\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2020.

That\u2019s how far\u00a0The Economist\u00a0went in relaying the value of data as a commodity, claiming it has now even surpassed the traditional monopoly of oil.\u00a0Indeed\u00a0and\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0have consistently ranked Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists as some of the hottest professions in the last few years and predict that the demand trend will only continue to grow well into the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning and mastering machine learning and data science can be overwhelming on the technical side. There are countless books, online courses, and graduate degrees that are offering this knowledge with varying breadth and depth \u2013 so,\u00a0where do you start?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThrough the rest of the article, we\u2019ll review some of the most popular books for data science and machine learning for various levels of expertise and understanding, both on technical topics as well as non technical ones. The books below are listed in no particular order and cover a large spectrum of the machine learning and data science fields. Some of these books will require familiarity with some coding languages, mathematical concepts or even prior machine learning experience, but we\u2019ll be sure to mention it if that\u2019s the case.\n\n\n\n\nSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nNick Bostrom\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$21.50 (Hardcover)  Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n909\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nFuture of AI; Moral Implications of AI; AI Philosophy; AI and Society\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cSuperintelligence asks the questions: What happens when machines surpass humans in general intelligence? Will artificial agents save or destroy us? Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life.\u00a0\n\nThe human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.\u00a0\n\nBut we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?\u00a0\n\nThis profoundly ambitious and original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy.\u00a0\n\nAfter an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNick Bostrom, in this book, artfully leverages his background in computational neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) with his inherent philosophical thinking to provide an unprecedented analysis of the future with AI.\u00a0\n\nBostrom imagines how we can create an AI far superior than we could have imagined and what risks it entails in terms of the world and societal power dynamics, while delving into how things can potentially go wrong and if superintelligence can replace us as the dominant lifeform on Earth. He talks about steering the future course through uncharted territory and navigating this still unknown terrain. The mere projection of such potentially grim scenarios forces us to begin considering solutions for them and the author looks at several such solutions.\n\nThis book is definitely written from a philosophical standpoint and a great insight into the world we are headed towards and the policies, regulations and thought leadership that is required for a harmonious co-existence.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe book was recommended by Bill Gates and Elon Musk as worth reading.\n\n\n\n\nDeep Learning with Python\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nFrancois Chollet\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$30.49-33.71 (Paperback)  Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n412\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nDeep Learning; Keras; Python; Neural Networks\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nDeep Learning Theory Basics (Recommended); Python (Basic)\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cDeep Learning with Python\u00a0introduces the field of deep learning using the Python language and the powerful Keras library. Written by Keras creator and Google AI researcher Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, this book builds your understanding through intuitive explanations and practical examples.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn this book, Francois Chollet covers practical deep learning implementation with the Keras library, which is a high-level API and considered a much better entry point for coders to deep learning than TensorFlow, for example, based on complexity. The text strikes a relatively good balance between covering basic foundational concepts with topics and considerations for the advanced practitioners and researchers.\u00a0\n\nMathematical concepts are explained using code snippets and the book is well suited for anyone with basic Python coding experience.\u00a0\n\nThe first part\u00a0of the book provides a general fundamental understanding and mathematical building blocks of both machine learning and deep learning. However, you will likely need another book for a more in-depth look into the theoretical side of Deep Learning such as \u201cDeep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)\u201d by Ian, Yoshua and Aaron, which is the next book discussed.\u00a0\n\nThe second part of the book\u00a0introduces different practical applications of deep learning networks including Computer vision with\u00a0convolutional neural networks (CNNs), natural language processing and transactional data (time series) with recurrent neural networks\u00a0(RNNs) and generating texts and images using variational autoencoders\u00a0(VANs) as well as\u00a0generative adversarial networks\u00a0(GANs). A recurring theme within deep learning is the problem of overfitting and the book addresses a range of solution techniques as well.\n\nAlthough all the examples are implemented using Keras, the topics are covered in general perspective and knowledge can be used with other similar high-level frameworks with relative ease.\n\nDeep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nIan Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$68.50-69.25 (Paperback)   Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n759\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nDeep Learning; Neural Networks; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nMachine Learning (Intermediate)\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out\u00a0of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.\u00a0\n\nThe text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.\u00a0\n\nDeep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWritten by luminaries in the field such as Yoshua Bengio, considered as one of the world\u2019s leading experts in AI and a pioneer in deep learning, this book is a rigorous and up to date reference of deep learning algorithms that is virtually self-contained.\n\nThe book has a good balance of mathematics (advanced statistics, linear algebra, numerical optimization), applications, and research topics. The applications section is definitely the meat of the book and the research topics will mostly be of interest to fellow machine learning researchers.\n\nDo note that this is a rather theoretical book and great for readers to gain intuition behind many of the concepts underpinning deep learning techniques taken for granted. Someone without any prior knowledge of machine learning probably would benefit from studying other introductory machine learning texts before tackling this one. Without a solid background, or at least a deep interest, in mathematics and practical hands-on experience with machine learning, this might end up being somewhat of a dense and challenging read.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nJudea Pearl, Dana Mackenzie\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$13.29 (Paperback)Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n343\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nAI; Causality; Data Science; Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cStart asking the big questions and learn how the study of causality revolutionized science and the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCause and effect: it's at the center of scientific inquiry, and yet for decades scientists had no way of answering simple questions, such as whether smoking causes cancer. In\u00a0The Book of Why, Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie show how Pearl's work on causality has broken through this stalemate, unleashing a revolution in our knowledge of the world. Anyone who wants to understand how science, the human mind, or artificial intelligence works needs\u00a0The Book of Why.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of Why is about Causality and discusses how it is different than Big Data and Correlation. Judea Pearl, the main author, argues that data and pattern recognition can only get you so far in understanding complex patterns, and that the more crucial piece is building transparent models on how the data was collected and produced in the first place.\u00a0Pearl expects that leveraging causal reasoning could provide machines with human-level intelligence.\u00a0\n\nTerms and concepts that are explored in the book include causality, correlation, mediation, transportability, counterfactuality, among others. Causality, in the context of how Pearl describes it, is around data transparency in understanding why a certain conclusion is reached. He provides many examples along the book on how just data correlation alone fails because of a lack of upstream transparency. The concepts are certainly more on the abstract side and complex with many intermingled ideas and thoughts, but it does caution around relying solely on data to predict future events.\u00a0\n\nHands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nAur\u00e9lien G\u00e9ron\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$43.99-48.07 (Paperback)    Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n416\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nMachine Learning; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks (DNN); Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nPython (Basic \u2013 Intermediate); Basic Statistics\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cThrough a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how.\n\nBy using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks\u2014Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow\u2014author Aur\u00e9lien G\u00e9ron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You\u2019ll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what you\u2019ve learned, all you need is programming experience to get started.\n\nExplore the machine learning landscape, particularly neural nets\n\nUse Scikit-Learn to track an example machine-learning project end-to-end\n\nExplore several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods\n\nUse the TensorFlow library to build and train neural nets\n\nDive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement learning\n\nLearn techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf you are comfortable with coding in Python and are looking for a quick introduction to both classical machine and deep learning techniques in Python from an experienced practitioner, this is a book well suited just for that. Hands-on Machine Learning is a great surface-level introduction to a vast array of machine learning and deep learning models, including their implementation in Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow (2.0). The book is comprehensive, written in a friendly tone, and contains a large set of excellent exercises, making it a great introduction to the knowledge areas as well as a useful reference text. The book also manages to strike a good balance between covering classical machine learning and deep learning, and the right amount of theory accompanied by references.\n\nAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nKai-Fu Lee\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$14.28 (Hardcover)Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n618\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nAI\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cDr. Kai-Fu Lee\u2014one of the world\u2019s most respected experts on AI and China\u2014reveals that China has suddenly caught up to the US at an astonishingly rapid and unexpected pace.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn\u00a0AI Superpowers, Kai-fu Lee argues powerfully that because of these unprecedented developments in AI, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us expected. Indeed, as the US-Sino AI competition begins to heat up, Lee urges the US and China to both accept and to embrace the great responsibilities that come with significant technological power. Most experts already say that AI will have a devastating impact on blue-collar jobs. But Lee predicts that Chinese and American AI will have a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. Is universal basic income the solution? In Lee\u2019s opinion, probably not.\u00a0 But he provides\u00a0a clear description of which jobs will be affected and how soon, which jobs can be enhanced with AI, and most importantly, how we can provide solutions to some of the most profound changes in human history that are coming soon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThis book is a potential eye opener for those of us unfamiliar with the wide-ranging capabilities and imminent impact of AI. Lee contrasts the Chinese\u2019s work in AI with that in the US. While Chinese AI is based on technologies developed in the US, Chinese companies are now developing their own strategic direction. Lee suggests a future which is not only filled with promise, but also fraught with social challenges, making a strong case that AI will soon determine the relative economic power of nations.\u00a0\n\nIn this book, Lee explains with striking clarity China is quickly becoming the AI superpower, having the perfect combination of: an indomitable entrepreneurial spirit; supportive government policies; well-trained AI scientists; and more data than any other country in the world.\u00a0\n\nThe book is an apt recommendation to anyone who wants an understanding of the first principles of AI, why it is so powerful and why we should be concerned about it from a political and societal standpoint. However, AI Superpowers doesn\u2019t really delve into the solutions side of things such as law, regulations, and moral responsibilities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nGareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$53.82 (Hardcover)  Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n550\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nStatistics; Machine Learning; R\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nBasic Statistics (preferred)\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cAn Introduction to Statistical Learning\u00a0provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.\n\nTwo of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers.\u00a0An Introduction to Statistical Learning\u00a0covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learningfocusses on all foundational topics systematically, assuming no prior knowledge from the readers, other than very basic statistics. Therefore, if you consider yourself a newbie, this book will help you approach data science easily.\n\nThe core statistical ideas of model optimization such as bias-variance tradeoffs are deeply discussed and revisited through multiple example problems. Chapter are like small case studies, developing progressively in complexity, each starting off with a research question, hypothesized models and data descriptions, followed by the data analysis and modelling with the code in R demonstrated with sufficient detail. No prior knowledge of R is required - the included R exercises are particularly helpful for beginners to learn R.\n\nDeep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nEric Topol\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$11.42-14.69 (Hardcover)  Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n143\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nHealthcare; AI\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cOne of America's top doctors reveals how AI will empower physicians and revolutionize patient care\u00a0Medicine has become inhuman, to disastrous effect. The doctor-patient relationship--the heart of medicine--is broken: doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In\u00a0Deep Medicine, leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help. AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient who needs to be heard.\n\nInnovative, provocative, and hopeful,\u00a0Deep Medicine\u00a0shows us how the awesome power of AI can make medicine better, for all the humans involved.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDeep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence can Make Healthcare Human Again provides a quick overview of AI, in what sectors it is being used, and then proceeds to discuss its application within the different branches of healthcare, including drug discovery, omics, diagnosis from radiography, virtual medicine (telemedicine, chatbots), nutrition, and mental health. Topol brings forth the argument that incorporating AI in executing these mundane and repetitive tasks that generally have solid boundaries of scope, will eventually free up doctors to focus on value-added human-to-human interactions with their patients that machines, no matter how sophisticated, are unlikely capable of duplicating. This book is potentially a great read for not only healthcare workers but also policy makers interested in driving change in the industry.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLife 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nMax Tegmark\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$15.03-15.86 (Hardcover)  Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n832\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nAI\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cHow will Artificial Intelligence affect crime, war, justice, jobs, society and our very sense of being human? The rise of AI has the potential to transform our future more than any other technology\u2014and there\u2019s nobody better qualified or situated to explore that future than Max Tegmark, an MIT professor who\u2019s helped mainstream research on how to keep AI beneficial.\n\u00a0\nHow can we grow our prosperity through automation without leaving people lacking income or purpose? What career advice should we give today\u2019s kids? How can we make future AI systems more robust, so that they do what we want without crashing, malfunctioning or getting hacked? Should we fear an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons? Will machines eventually outsmart us at all tasks, replacing humans on the job market and perhaps altogether? Will AI help life flourish like never before or give us more power than we can handle?\n\u00a0\nWhat sort of future do\u00a0you\u00a0want? This book empowers you to join what may be the most important conversation of our time. It doesn\u2019t shy away from the full range of viewpoints or from the most controversial issues\u2014from superintelligence to meaning, consciousness and the ultimate physical limits on life in the cosmos.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn Life 3.0, Max Tegmark describes the present, future, and distant future possibilities about the impacts of AI accompanied by a discussion on the popular controversies, myths and misconceptions associated with AI, before moving on to a discussion on what we really mean by \u201cintelligence\u201d.\u00a0\n\nOverall, Tegmark remains optimistic, stating that technology is responsible for nearly all the improvements in the quality of life since the stone age and it will only continue on that path. At the same time, he convincingly illustrates the necessity for further evaluation of our goals as a society and plans for AI\u2019s integration into our lives\u2014one that can be the most important conversation of our times.\n\nThe author breaks down complex concepts with simple comparisons and manages to keep things, and steer clear of exaggerations, with in-depth breakdown of every possible scenario AI might take, both promising as well as grim ones. Regardless of your field of study or profession, the book really makes you ponder what \u201cvalues\u201d you want machines and AI to have.\u00a0\n\nIntroduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nAndreas C Muller, Sarah Guido\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$49.89 (Paperback)  Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n157\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.2\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nMachine Learning; NLP; Python; Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nPython (Basic)\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cMachine learning has become an integral part of many commercial applications and research projects, but this field is not exclusive to large companies with extensive research teams.

With the plethora of illustrations in the book, this book is a must-read for ones who have a visual learning method and want to learn coding. This book is geared towards beginner-level programmers and individuals without a background in Computer Science and advanced Software Engineers or individuals with a degree in Computer Science and well versed in algorithms probably will likely find this book too high level.\u00a0\n\nThe focus of the book is definitely data structures and algorithms, more so than machine learning specifically. Although it\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0cover all the data structure and algorithms\u00a0you generally see within Computer Science, but the ones it does cover, it does so very well!\n\nData structure\u00a0and\u00a0algorithms\u00a0is definitely a very interesting knowledge area, especially at the higher level topics, but can quickly grow to be complex and hard to visualize, especially if not explained very well - and that is where this book stands out.\n\nHands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\n\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\n\n\t\n\nAur\u00e9lien G\u00e9ron\n\n\n\n\nPrice Range (USD):\n\n\t\n\n$25.27-36.10 (Paperback)  Buy on Amazon.com\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Reviews:\n\n\t\n\n786\n\n\n\n\nAverage Review Rating (out of 5)\n\n\t\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\t\n\nMachine Learning; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks (DNN); Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\t\n\nPython (Basic \u2013 Intermediate); Basic Statistics\n\n\n\n\nBook Abstract:\n\n\t\n\n\u201cThrough a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how.\n\nBy using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks\u2014 Scikit-learn and TensorFlow\u2014author Aur\u00e9lien G\u00e9ron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You\u2019ll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what you\u2019ve learned, all you need is programming experience to get started.\n\nExplore the machine learning landscape, particularly neural nets\n\nUse scikit-learn to track an example machine-learning project end-to-end\n\nExplore several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods\n\nUse the TensorFlow library to build and train neural nets\n\nDive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement learning\n\nLearn techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets\n\nApply practical code examples without acquiring excessive machine learning theory or algorithm details\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn the first few pages of the book, G\u00e9ron provides an overview of Machine Learning (ML) systems, the main challenges around ML models, and perspectives on testing and validation of models.\n\nThis is followed by a few hands-on, end-to-end ML projects implemented with Scikit-learn libraries. Through the chapters, the author provides guidance on how you should approach framing a given problem, selecting the performance evaluation measure(s), extracting the data, performing exploratory data analysis and visualization, preparing and cleaning the data, selecting and training the model, tuning the model hyperparameters, and concluding with topics on launching, monitoring, and maintaining the system.\n\nMultiple ML models are discussed, including, but not limited to, linear and logistic regressions, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), decision trees, ensemble methods (GBM, random forest), as well as feature engineering topics such as dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n\nConceptual introduction to neural nets is also included in the book in the form of Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN\u2019s) with Tensorflow.\n\nHands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow is better suited for the advanced novices. The book provides good practical tips and hints to help you to build good instincts as a data scientist.\u00a0It is best if you are already comfortable with coding in Python; and without a background in statistics, you could be prone to making poor choices once you start modelling the problems.\u00a0\n\nLeave a comment...\n\n\n\n\nPOST COMMENT\n\nComments\n\nThere are no comments yet.", "images":

regulations.\n\nAbout half of financial services and insurance firms globally already use AI, according to a 2019 study by research group Forrester, and that number is expected to grow as new uses are found for the technology.\n\n\u201cWe are only scratching the surface of the potential that AI has for the industry,\u201d says Katherine Wetmur, Morgan Stanley\u2019s international chief information officer.\n\nFinancial institutions already use AI to analyse stock market data and machine learning to improve fraud detection \u2014 technology that Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, last year said saves the US bank $150m annually.\n\nAnother US bank, Morgan Stanley, also uses AI for fraud detection, virtual assistants for customer inquiries and for \u201csentiment analysis\u201d, which measures how positive or negative an analyst is about a company stock.\n\nWhat you will end up with is banks that are run primarily by managers and machines. The managers decide what the machines need to do, and the machines do the job\n\nAs AI improves, chatbots will sound more lifelike and better understand human communication, helped by natural language processing technologies, according to Ms Wetmur.\n\nCustomers of Chinese insurer Ping An who are in a vehicle accident can use its AI-powered smartphone app to take a picture of the crash and receive an insurance quote for repairing damage within three minutes.\n\nThe app instructs the customer which pictures to take \u2014 for example, identifying the car, damage and accident location. It verifies the car owner\u2019s identity and that they are a legitimate customer, before giving a repair quote.\n\n\u201cWe are able to give a very, very accurate repair estimate,\u201d says Jonathan Larsen, Ping An\u2019s chief innovation officer.\n\nInsurers are also using AI to analyse large amounts of data and identify connections and anomalies, simplifying an insurance agent\u2019s task of determining whether a claim may be fraudulent.\n\n\u201cIt takes AI to find the patterns of similar claims behaviour in large sets of disparate historical data, identify the statistical anomaly of accident likelihood based on geolocation data, and make those connections a single human claims professional may never see,\u201d says Jeremy Jawish, co-founder of Shift Technology, a French software company specialising in AI for insurers.\n\nFor smaller fintech companies such as Ireland\u2019s Trezeo, AI is used to tailor services to customers\u2019 needs. The company uses AI to analyse customers\u2019 income and outgoings \u2014 mainly self-employed people working in the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2014 to help them manage their finances.\n\n\u201c[Trezeo\u2019s AI] understands your typical income pattern, for example busy periods for an Uber driver, and can smooth your income by setting aside income from your busy time when you earn more for quieter periods,\u201d says Oliwia Berdak, a financial services expert at Forrester.\n\nAI is also being combined with internet-connected devices to automate payments. FINN, a start-up created by Dutch bank ING, embeds its payment software in sensors within devices such as cars, lockers and coffee machines.\n\nRecommended\nSpecial ReportAI & Robotics\n\u2018Death of the office\u2019 exaggerated despite homeworking boom\n\nSmart devices make autonomous payments based on a pre-determined trigger \u2014 for example, when a car passes through a toll gate or when a coffee machine needs its beans restocked. FINN charges customers a monthly fee and an additional payment each time its service is used.\n\nExperts believe that while AI technologies including machine learning, robotic process automation and \u201cnatural language understanding\u201d will soon be utilised in more aspects of financial services, the technology has its limits.\n\n\u201cWe are not at the level yet where machines [have] the equivalent [intelligence] of humans,\u201d says Chris Skinner, a financial services consultant and author. \u201cBut [AI] is getting more and more advanced every day.\u201d\n\nIn future, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Ms Wetmur believes \u201c[AI] will become more accessible, more democratised and more standardised\u201d as its computer code becomes freely available as open source technology.\n\nHowever, when AI can to handle complex tasks previously performed by humans, job losses are inevitable, experts say.\n\n\u201cMost trading and investment roles will disappear and over time, probably most roles that require human services will be automated,\u201d says Mr Skinner. \u201cWhat you will end up with is banks that are run primarily by managers and machines. The managers decide what the machines need to do, and the machines do the job.\u201d\n\nGet alerts on Artificial intelligence when a new story is published\n\nGet alerts\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2020.

With millions of workers now getting a taste for working from home, it's unclear whether many will return. Spending less time commuting, more time with the family, and increasing personal productivity are just a handful of the remote working benefits driving a potential long-term change.\n\nBusiness leaders, HR and learning and development professionals have a challenging new context to contend with. The shift to remote working represents an opportunity to enhance workforce development and the up-skilling of employees by leveraging the power of digital learning. And the good news is that there's a wealth of pioneering technology providers that are helping in this space. Here's a handpicked selection:\n\nInsideOut \u00a0\n\nInsideOut is a workplace wellness movement that is leading the change in improving mental health care in the workplace. The platform matches users with curated content and experienced therapists based on individual needs, providing a safe space for employees to talk about their mental health. In turn, employers can gain a detailed understanding of the mental health landscape of their organisations through anonymous surveying, and set up initiatives to keep mental health a high priority.\u00a0\n\nHow InsideOut Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nWorking from home is not rosy for everyone. Work-life balance can be negatively impacted for some, and feelings of isolation and disconnect can intensify. InsideOut ensures workers can speak up and receive the support they need. Having mental health care as a crucial part of your employee assistance plans can improve performance and productivity while also reducing absenteeism.\n\nUptale\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUptale is an immersive learning platform designed for businesses to create, share and track training modules in 360\u00b0 photos or videos and virtual reality. Weaving together technology, theoretical content, and practical exercises can create endless training environments. Workers, in turn, are trained better and faster compared to some traditional methods. Demonstrating its versatility, Uptale has already been used to train over 130,000 people in 140 countries across a range of sectors, from manufacturing and retail to healthcare and education.\u00a0\n\nMost Popular In: Entrepreneurs\nNew Visa Program Offers $10,000 Grants To Black Women Entrepreneurs\nMeet 25 Leading Black British Business People To Follow\nChurchill The Failure: The Paradoxical Truth About The Best And Worst Leaders\n\nHow Uptale Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nOnboarding new staff and running regular training sessions need not be a dismal Zoom-intensive operation in a socially distanced world. Uptale\u2019s impressive technology allows businesses to build efficient and engaging virtual learning environments easily: helping new-starters get quickly operational and familiar with their future work environment, training in basic safety rules, practicing order preparation and much more. Importantly, it frees up the time and resources usually involved in running these programmes.\n\nGuider\n\nGuider is on a mission to help professionals and companies achieve their goals through meaningful and effective mentoring. Guider combines AI-technology and industry-leading expertise to match and grow mentoring relationships inside organisations. Tailored mentoring and coaching programmes also help to improve Diversity & Inclusion, Women in Leadership, High-Potentials and more.\u00a0\n\nHow Guider Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nAs companies come to terms with remote working being the norm, it\u2019s still important to have different parts of an organisations talking, helping and ideating with each other. For junior employees, in particular, mentoring is an essential part of development. And for future company leaders, coaching and mentoring is a crucial way to develop effective management skills. Remote working needn't eradicate this time-old business practice.\u00a0\n\nChatterbox\n\nChatterbox is an online language learning platform that gives employees the tools to develop cultural intelligence while positively changing the world. Employees are algorithmically connected to native language coaches - trained refugees with professional expertise spanning engineering, business and academia. AI-assisted multimedia course content supports the development of language skills alongside live practice with coaches.\n\nHow Chatterbox Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nThe benefits of corporate language learning programs are broad-ranging; from improved employee confidence to increased retention and better collaboration. Online language training is now centre stage. Chatterbox offers a personalised, adaptive learning experience based on learners' proficiency and goals, while also benefiting one of the most vulnerable groups of people in our global society thanks to our digitally connected world.\n\nPaddle\n\nPaddle is an AI-powered talent mobility and career growth platform built to retain, engage, and inspire talent. Powered by over 440 million peoples' skills, Paddle's Talent Marketplace enables users to quickly staff up projects with employees who already have the skills companies need.\n\nHow Paddle Can Help Remote Workforces\n\nIt's never been more critical to create a working environment that encourages internal talent and innovation. Remote working is a challenge to this premise, but having a deep understanding of your talent pool provides the necessary insight to direct meaningful talent redeployment, and better support employees\u2019 personal development plans.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\u00a0\nMursal Hedayat\n\nI am a Forbes 30 Under 30 Social Entrepreneur and co-founder of Chatterbox, a smart online language and cultural training platform for professionals powered by refugees.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u00a0Read More\nSite Feedback\nTips\nCorrections\nReprints & Permissions\nTerms\nPrivacy\n\u00a9 2020 Forbes Media LLC.

Aimee Chanthadavong | July 3, 2020 -- 05:42 GMT (13:42 GMT+08:00) | Topic: Innovation\n\nNEC and the Japan Agency Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) have developed a system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) imaging recognition techniques to automatically detect microplastics from seawater and sediment samples.\n\nThe system, according to NEC, has been developed using its Rapid machine learning technology in combination with JAMESTEC's method for staining microplastics using fluorescent dyes in samples, before capturing videos of the dyed microplastics.\n\nThe software then automatically extracts image data for each microplastic that appears in the video and uses AI recognition technology to sort microplastics based on sizes and shapes at a processing speed of 60 per minute, NEC said.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate touted the new system could improve the current method that is used to analyse microplastics to determine the impact plastic waste has on marine life.\n\nTypically, the process of analysing microplastics involves scooping seawater and sediment with a fine mesh, before using a microscope to pick and analyse each microplastic manually to determine the number, size, and types that exist in the ocean.\n\n\"It is expected that by establishing and popularising this measurement method, and by clarifying the actual situation of microplastic pollution, we will be able to contribute to the formulation of appropriate emission regulations,\" JAMSTEC marine plastics research deputy group leader Masashi Tsuchiya.\n\nRecently, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) inked a partnership with Microsoft to look at how AI could be used to tackle plastic waste, as well as illegal fishing, and how it can help boost farming.\n\nBy collecting data about the spread and concentration of plastic, CSIRO is using AI and ML to analyse where the plastic might end up and also what steps can be taken on land to reduce the likelihood of plastic entering waterways and oceans. \u00a0\n\n\"Reverse vending machines\", where the public can recycle bottles and cans in return for a fee, is also on the list for

In an effort to improve accuracy of food desert locations, the UT Dallas researchers looked at two additional variables not included by the USDA: access to public transit and shopper-provided food pricing gathered from Yelp, an online source of business reviews by the public.\n\n\"If a community has few public transportation options nearby, that may contribute to the existence of a food desert,\" Kim said. \"Plus, low-income households still face limited access to healthy food if prices are too high.\"\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from Dallas' 296 census tracts, which are neighborhood-sized geographical areas used by government agencies to collect population data. Nine census tracts were identified as food deserts based on the USDA's 2015 data only. Using 2018 Yelp data alone, the researchers identified 50 census tracts -- mostly in south Dallas -- as food deserts. Thirty-three census tracts were overlapped by both data sources.\n\nDue to the time difference between the two data sources, Kim cautioned that their findings could not confirm which dataset -- USDA vs. Yelp -- matches the situation on the ground more accurately, and he stressed that Yelp should not be considered as a replacement for government data. The results do show, however, that crowdsourced, georeferenced data could be a good supplement to improve accuracy of official government data and help guide health policies.\n\n\"Yelp data is still incomplete in coverage and limited for wide application, although it has the potential to be improved in the future,\" Kim said. \"This study sheds light on the need for on-the-ground, place-specific observation in the study of food deserts, and future studies should include multiple cities to gauge the quality of Yelp data across the country.\"\n\nKim added that use of such crowdsourced information also could give guidance to other public-health mapping, such as for noise or pollution.\n\n###\n\nOther contributors to the study included first author Thomas McKey, UT Dallas geospatial information sciences doctoral student, and Dr. SungChul Seo from Eulji University, South Korea.\n\nThe study was supported by the Environmental Health Action Program, funded by the Ministry of Environment, South Korea.\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.\n\nSHARE\n\u00a0PRINT\u00a0E-MAIL\n\nMedia Contact\n\nAmanda Siegfried\namanda.siegfried@uutdallas.edu\n 972-883-4335\n\n\u00a0@ut_dallas\n\nhttp://www.utdallas.edu\u00a0\n\nMore on this News Release\nStudy: Crowdsourced data could help map urban food deserts\n\nUNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS\n\nJOURNAL\nFrontiers in Public Health\nFUNDER\nSouth Korean Ministry of Environment\nKEYWORDS\nDEMOGRAPHY\nINFORMATION MANAGEMENT/TRACKING SYSTEMS\nNUTRITION/NUTRIENTS\nPUBLIC HEALTH\nSOCIAL/BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE\nSOCIOECONOMICS\nSOCIOECONOMICS\nORIGINAL SOURCE\nhttps://www.utdallas.edu/news/social-sciences/food-deserts-study-2020/\nRELATED JOURNAL ARTICLE\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00071\nMore in Social & Behavior\nCenter for BrainHealth advances understanding of brain connectivity in cannabis users\nCENTER FOR BRAINHEALTH\nStudy: Crowdsourced data could help map urban food deserts\nUNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS\nHow prison and police discrimination affect black sexual minority men's health\nRUTGERS UNIVERSITY\nResearchers examine refugee children's academic, social, and emotional learning outcomes\nNEW YORK UNIVERSITY\nView all in Social & Behavior\u00a0\nTrending News Releases\nRadar points to moon being more metallic than researchers thought\nNASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER\nFeeds of the future\nUNIVERSITY OF G\u00d6TTINGEN\nEven in the worst COVID-19 cases, the body launches immune cells to fight back\nLA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY\nHistoric floods reveal how salt marshes can save lives in the future\nROYAL NETHERLANDS INSTITUTE FOR SEA RESEARCH\nView all latest news releases\u00a0\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)\n\nLatest News Releases RSS Feed\nAll EurekAlert!

ANANYA MALHOTRA, RESEARCH FELLOW IN STATISTICS, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE &TROPICAL MEDICINE, LONDON, UK view more\u00a0\n\nCREDIT: ESMO PRESS OFFICE\n\nLugano, Switzerland, 2 July 2020 - Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for enabling earlier detection of pancreatic cancer, which is crucial to saving lives. The potential of AI is showcased in a study to be presented at the ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer, 1-4 July 2020. (1, 2)\n\nOverall, 12 in every 100,000 people develop pancreatic cancer. This means that screening everyone would be inefficient and would expose many people to unnecessary tests and potential side-effects. Between 70-80% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is too late for curative treatment and five years after diagnosis, just 6% of patients have survived.\n\nScreening helps identify cancer early, when treatments are most effective, thus improving survival. There are two main requirements for screening. First, a screening test that is easy to perform and has few side-effects. Second, a defined group that would benefit most from screening because they are at higher risk. For example, breast cancer screening involves mammography in women aged 50 to 71 years. AI could be the desperately needed answer to define a group of higher risk individuals that would benefit from screening, especially as recently some promising results have indicated that non-invasive tests for pancreatic cancer may soon be available.\n\nIt is known that patients who develop pancreatic cancer consult their general practitioner (GP) with non-specific symptoms such as gastrointestinal problems or back pain more frequently in the months and years prior to diagnosis compared with their peers who do not develop pancreatic cancer. Individually, these symptoms are unlikely to trigger further investigations for cancer. Researchers came up with the idea that AI could find a combination of these non-specific symptoms that is linked with higher risk of contracting the disease, which would be difficult to spot by GPs.\n\nThis preliminary study used electronic health records from GP practices in the UK. (3) The analysis included 1,378 patients aged 15-99 years diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2005 to 2010. Each patient was matched by age and sex to four people who did not get pancreatic cancer. Information on symptoms, diseases, and medications in the two years prior to diagnosis were used to create a model predicting who would develop pancreatic cancer. \"We used AI to study a large volume of data and look for combinations that predict who will develop pancreatic cancer,\" said study author Dr. Ananya Malhotra, research fellow in statistics, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK. \"It's not possible for the human eye to recognise these trends in such large amounts of data.\"\n\nThe pilot study found that in people under 60 years of age, the model could predict who was at higher risk of pancreatic cancer up to 20 months before diagnosis. \"Our model has estimated that around 1,500 tests need to be performed to save one life from pancreatic cancer,\" explained Malhotra. \"This is unlikely to be small enough to make screening viable just yet. However, it shows that AI holds potential to narrow down the number of people we need to screen. We should be able to reduce this quite a lot further by matching pancreatic cancer patients to controls from the general population, which is what we plan to do next (in the current study, the controls had other types of cancer).\"\n\n\"Pairing this predictive model with a non-invasive screening test, followed by scans and biopsies, could lead to earlier diagnosis for a significant proportion of patients and a greater number of patients surviving this cancer,\" added Malhotra.\n\nUsing AI to identify people at high-risk of pancreatic cancer up to 20 months earlier could make the difference between life and death. \"This should be enough time to screen for pancreatic cancer, then proceed with diagnosis and treatment in patients with a positive screening test,\" said Dr. Angela Lamarca, consultant in medical oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. \"Early diagnosis in pancreatic cancer gives the highest chance of cure.\"\n\nAccording to Lamarca, GPs could use this type of AI model on their medical records to highlight patients at higher risk. An alarm could be raised showing who should receive screening. She said: \"We need bigger studies incorporating AI tools into daily clinical practice and exploring the benefit of screening the patients selected by AI. More research is also needed to find a good screening test for these high-risk patients.\"\n\n###\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nPlease make sure to use the official name of the meeting in your reports: ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer?\n\nOfficial Congress Hashtag: #WorldGI2020\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis press release contains information provided by the author of the highlighted abstract and reflects the content of this abstract.

Identifying a sub-population of patients at high risk of subsequent diagnosis using machine learning techniques applied to primary care data\n\nA. Malhotra1, B. Rachet1, A. Bonaventure2, S. Pereira3, L. Woods1\n\n1London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom; 2CRESS, University of Paris, Paris, France; 3UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, London, United Kingdom\n\nBackground: Ninety-four percent of pancreatic cancer patients die within 5 years of their diagnosis. Most patients experience no obvious symptoms until the tumour is well advanced. It is now possible, via a blood test, to detect pancreatic cancer before symptoms of late-stage disease are evident. However, in order to be cost-effective, this test should only be applied to a limited group of individuals.\n\nMethods: We conducted a national, population-based, case-control study to deter-mine whether it is possible to identify a sub-population of patients at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Our hypothesis was that patients with early malignancy share similar profiles of early, diffuse, warning signs which might be detectable through the application of machine learning approaches. We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), linked to the national cancer registrations. Our cases comprised of 1,378 patients, aged 15-99 years, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Each case was individually age- and diagnosis time-matched to four non-pancreatic (cancer) controls. Disease, symptom and prescription codes for the 24 months prior to diagnosis were used to define 58 individual symptoms. Using a machine learning approach, we fitted logistic regression and random forest models. These models were trained on 75% of the data and tested on the remaining 25%.\n\nResults: Preliminary results show that diagnosis could be accurately predicted for 60%of the patients below the age of 60 using their medical history recorded between 20-24 months before diagnosis with an AUC of 61%, sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 45%.\n\nConclusion: A sub-population of patients later diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is detectable up to 20 months before diagnosis. Further work should test the performance of the model for longer time periods as well as its effectiveness in a population-based setting. These data suggest that early detection of pancreatic cancer is possible. Pairing this predictive model with a screening test could lead to earlier diagnosis and a greater number of patients surviving this devastating disease.\n\nLegal entity responsible for the study: The authors.\n\nFunding: Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund.\n\nDisclosure: The presenting author has declared no conflicts of interest.\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.\n\nSHARE\n\u00a0PRINT\u00a0E-MAIL\n\nMedia Contact\n\nESMO Press Office\nmedia@esmo.org\n\n\u00a0@myesmo\n\nhttp://www.esmo.org\u00a0\n\nMore on this News Release\nArtificial intelligence brings pancreatic cancer screening one step closer to reality\n\nEUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL ONCOLOGY\n\nJOURNAL\nAnnals of Oncology\nMEETING\nESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2020\nKEYWORDS\nCANCER\nCLINICAL TRIALS\nHEALTH CARE SYSTEMS/SERVICES\nHEALTH PROFESSIONALS\nMEDICAL EDUCATION\nMEDICINE/HEALTH\nPUBLIC HEALTH\nMULTIMEDIA\nDr. Ananya Malhotra (IMAGE)\nview MORE\u00a0\nRELATED JOURNAL ARTICLE\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.028\nMore in Medicine & Health\nProtective antibodies identified for rare, polio-like disease in children\nPURDUE UNIVERSITY\nNovel biomarker discovery could lead to early diagnosis for deadly preeclampsia\nUNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY\nMorning exercise is the key to a good night's sleep after heart bypass surgery\nEUROPEAN SOCIETY OF CARDIOLOGY\nSurge in domestic child abuse during pandemic, reports specialist UK children's hospital\nBMJ\nView all in Medicine & Health\u00a0\nTrending News Releases\nRadar points to moon being more metallic than researchers thought\nNASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER\nFeeds of the future\nUNIVERSITY OF G\u00d6TTINGEN\nEven in the worst COVID-19 cases, the body launches immune cells to fight back\nLA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY\nHistoric floods reveal how salt marshes can save lives in the future\nROYAL NETHERLANDS INSTITUTE FOR SEA RESEARCH\nView all latest news releases\u00a0\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)\n\nLatest News Releases RSS Feed\nAll EurekAlert!
