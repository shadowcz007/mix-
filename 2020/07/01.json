But this approach, known as \u201cdigital humanities\u201d, is in a battle for funding against more future-focused applications of AI.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest in digital humanities, but there is not a lot of money,\u201d says Ilan Shimshoni, professor of computer vision and machine learning at the University of Haifa in Israel, where he works on archaeological projects that include reassembling artefacts from photos of fragments. \u201cIf you want to do an analysis of Facebook you\u2019ll get much more money than if you want to look at ancient Greek artefacts.\u201d\n\nArchaeological puzzles may not seem as urgent as computer science projects in healthcare, finance and other industries, but applying algorithmic techniques to historical research can improve AI\u2019s capabilities, says Ayellet Tal, an archaeological and computer science researcher at Israel\u2019s Technion University.\n\nRestoring or recreating archaeological artefacts is a complicated problem for computer vision models. Previous work \u2014 algorithms learning to reassemble photos or documents, for example \u2014 has not accounted for the degradation of fragments, unclear images or imprecise piece-fitting.\n\nIf you want to do an analysis of Facebook you\u2019ll get much more money than if you want to look at ancient Greek artefacts\n\nBefore attempting to reconstruct artefacts, the AI model learnt how to reverse the erosion process and predict what original fragments looked like. Researchers then defined how the model should test whether fragments fitted together.\n\n\u201cThe tasks in archaeology are classical computer vision problems,\u201d says Ms Tal. \u201cBut they are much more difficult in archaeology because the objects are not nicely behaved. We want to transform archaeology and we want to advance computer vision because these tasks are where current algorithms fail.\u201d\n\nIBM Japan and Yamagata University last year presented the first geoglyph \u2014 a large human-made ancient formation or design on the ground \u2014 identified by AI. The task required huge amounts of high resolution image data, which IBM saw as both a challenge and an opportunity to test its AI and computing capabilities.\n\n\u201cThese geoglyphs are not only spread across miles of land, but the nature of the landscape means it can be difficult to discern clues that point to new formations,\u201d says Akihisa Sakurai, an IBM engineer.\n\nDeepMind, Google\u2019s AI lab, has also targeted ancient mysteries. Yannis Assael, a DeepMind research scientist, last year published a paper with Oxford university historian Thea Sommerschield on a deep learning model called Pythia, designed to fill the gaps of missing text in ancient Greek inscriptions. In addition to developing a tool for historians, the research tackled a big challenge in AI: understanding algorithmic decision-making.\n\nBy assigning weightings to parts of the input text it used to predict missing characters, historians can better evaluate Pythia\u2019s predictions. The technique also helps improve neural networks with transparent decision-making processes in other contexts.\n\nRecommended\nSpecial ReportAI & Robotics\n\u2018Death of the office\u2019 exaggerated despite homeworking boom\n\nFor Matthew Connelly, professor of digital history and principal investigator for The History Lab, a UK data-driven research group, it is crucial that historians recognise the role that algorithms play in historical understanding.\n\nResearchers increasingly deal with digitised information as opposed to sources that have been manually curated into archives. If historians do not adapt their methods of searching and analysing sources, their theories and conclusions will be distorted, he says.\n\nFor example, physical documents can be digitised using an AI technique called optical character recognition. Even with high accuracy, letters and words are frequently misidentified or missing entirely. At a more fundamental level, historical data may mislead historians when algorithms are used to select what gets archived and what gets deleted.\n\nProf Connelly recently highlighted his concerns in a New York Times op-ed about the US State Department\u2019s practice of using machine learning to separate its documents into \u201chistoric\u201d records to be archived, and \u201ctemporary\u201d records to be deleted. Machine learning algorithms can overpredict historical significance for some documents and overlook others that will prove to be important, he warns, which he demonstrated in a project with Microsoft called \u201cPredicting History\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US government is using machine learning algorithms to destroy part of the historic record,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of history as we know it.\u201d\n\nThe US government is using machine learning algorithms to destroy part of the historic record. It\u2019s the end of history as we know it\n\nProf Connelly says his research on official secrecy can only be done with machine learning and data science techniques, and \u2014 like restoring missing text in ancient inscriptions \u2014 uses algorithms that learn to fill in the gaps.\n\nWhat gets left out of history has real-world consequences on matters of policy such as healthcare, economics and international relations. Matthew Lincoln, art historian and data research scientist, notes that this particularly affects people and groups with less power and privilege.\n\nMr Lincoln believes that machine learning is best placed to expose the gaps in historical records, but he cautions that historians must take a critical view when applying data science techniques.\n\n\u201cIf historians use machine learning naively on data generated from archival sources, it will reinforce those existing gaps,\u201d he says. \u201cPoorly-made data analyses can unwittingly lend an air of objectivity to historical arguments that really can\u2019t be supported by these incomplete archives.\u201d\n\nGet alerts on Artificial intelligence when a new story is published\n\nGet alerts\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2020.

regulations.\n\nAbout half of financial services and insurance firms globally already use AI, according to a 2019 study by research group Forrester, and that number is expected to grow as new uses are found for the technology.\n\n\u201cWe are only scratching the surface of the potential that AI has for the industry,\u201d says Katherine Wetmur, Morgan Stanley\u2019s international chief information

last year said saves the US bank $150m annually.\n\nAnother US bank, Morgan Stanley, also uses AI for fraud detection, virtual assistants for customer inquiries and for \u201csentiment analysis\u201d, which measures how positive or negative an analyst is about a company stock.\n\nWhat you will end up with is banks that are run primarily by managers and machines. The managers decide what the machines need to do, and the machines do the job\n\nAs AI improves, chatbots will sound more lifelike and better understand human communication, helped by natural language processing technologies, according to Ms Wetmur.\n\nCustomers of Chinese insurer Ping An who are in a vehicle accident can use its AI-powered smartphone app to take a picture of the crash and receive an insurance quote for repairing damage within three minutes.\n\nThe app instructs the customer which pictures to take \u2014 for example, identifying the car, damage and accident location. It verifies the car owner\u2019s identity and that they are a legitimate customer, before giving a repair quote.\n\n\u201cWe are able to give a very, very accurate repair estimate,\u201d says Jonathan Larsen, Ping An\u2019s chief innovation officer.\n\nInsurers are also using AI to analyse large amounts of data and identify connections and anomalies, simplifying an insurance agent\u2019s task of determining whether a claim may be fraudulent.\n\n\u201cIt takes AI to find the patterns of similar claims behaviour in large sets of disparate historical data, identify the statistical anomaly of accident likelihood based on geolocation data, and make those connections a single human claims professional may never see,\u201d says Jeremy Jawish, co-founder of Shift Technology, a French software company specialising in AI for insurers.\n\nFor smaller fintech companies such as Ireland\u2019s Trezeo, AI is used to tailor services to customers\u2019 needs. The company uses AI to analyse customers\u2019 income and outgoings \u2014 mainly self-employed people working in the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2014 to help them manage their finances.\n\n\u201c[Trezeo\u2019s AI] understands your typical income pattern, for example busy periods for an Uber driver, and can smooth your income by setting aside income from your busy time when you earn more for quieter periods,\u201d says Oliwia Berdak, a financial services expert at Forrester.\n\nAI is also being combined with internet-connected devices to automate payments. FINN, a start-up created by Dutch bank ING, embeds its payment software in sensors within devices such as cars, lockers and coffee machines.\n\nRecommended\nSpecial ReportAI & Robotics\n\u2018Death of the office\u2019 exaggerated despite homeworking boom\n\nSmart devices make autonomous payments based on a pre-determined trigger \u2014 for example, when a car passes through a toll gate or when a coffee machine needs its beans restocked. FINN charges customers a monthly fee and an additional payment each time its service is used.\n\nExperts believe that while AI technologies including machine learning, robotic process automation and \u201cnatural language understanding\u201d will soon be utilised in more aspects of financial services, the technology has its limits.\n\n\u201cWe are not at the level yet where machines [have] the equivalent [intelligence] of humans,\u201d says Chris Skinner, a financial services consultant and author. \u201cBut [AI] is getting more and more advanced every day.\u201d\n\nIn future, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Ms Wetmur believes \u201c[AI] will become more accessible, more democratised and more standardised\u201d as its computer code becomes freely available as open source technology.\n\nHowever, when AI can to handle complex tasks previously performed by humans, job losses are inevitable, experts say.\n\n\u201cMost trading and investment roles will disappear and over time, probably most roles that require human services will be automated,\u201d says Mr Skinner. \u201cWhat you will end up with is banks that are run primarily by managers and machines. The managers decide what the machines need to do, and the machines do the job.\u201d\n\nGet alerts on Artificial intelligence when a new story is published\n\nGet alerts\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2020.
