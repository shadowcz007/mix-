Aimee Chanthadavong | July 3, 2020 -- 05:42 GMT (13:42 GMT+08:00) | Topic: Innovation\n\nNEC and the Japan Agency Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) have developed a system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) imaging recognition techniques to automatically detect microplastics from seawater and sediment samples.\n\nThe system, according to NEC, has been developed using its Rapid machine learning technology in combination with JAMESTEC's method for staining microplastics using fluorescent dyes in samples, before capturing videos of the dyed microplastics.\n\nThe software then automatically extracts image data for each microplastic that appears in the video and uses AI recognition technology to sort microplastics based on sizes and shapes at a processing speed of 60 per minute, NEC said.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate touted the new system could improve the current method that is used to analyse microplastics to determine the impact plastic waste has on marine life.\n\nTypically, the process of analysing microplastics involves scooping seawater and sediment with a fine mesh, before using a microscope to pick and analyse each microplastic manually to determine the number, size, and types that exist in the ocean.\n\n\"It is expected that by establishing and popularising this measurement method, and by clarifying the actual situation of microplastic pollution, we will be able to contribute to the formulation of appropriate emission regulations,\" JAMSTEC marine plastics research deputy group leader Masashi Tsuchiya.\n\nRecently, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) inked a partnership with Microsoft to look at how AI could be used to tackle plastic waste, as well as illegal fishing, and how it can help boost farming.\n\nBy collecting data about the spread and concentration of plastic, CSIRO is using AI and ML to analyse where the plastic might end up and also what steps can be taken on land to reduce the likelihood of plastic entering waterways and oceans. \u00a0\n\n\"Reverse vending machines\", where the public can recycle bottles and cans in return for a fee, is also on the list for exploration. \u00a0\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\nDrones and AI making a dent in Kakadu's war against weeds\u00a0\nSmart coral reefs: This underwater, fish-spotting AI helps protect the rainforest of the

The technology is all-pervasive across its operations.\n\nThe AI Foundation\n\nKeep in mind that the insurance industry was actually the first industry that was data driven.\u00a0The roots go back to 1662 when John Graunt helped to create modern statistics, which he used to calculate the probabilities for life expectancies for those living in London.\u00a0The framework would lead to the creation of Lloyd's of London.\n\nThe result is that the insurance industry has turned into one of the most valuable the world has ever seen.\u00a0As of today, property, casualty and life premiums represent a whopping $5 trillion and account for 11% of the GDP in the US.\u00a0\n\nMost Popular In: Entrepreneurs\nThis Common Practice Is Killing Small Businesses\nWhy Every Small Business Should Consider A Bounce Back Loan\nBritain\u2019s Fastest Growing Start-Ups Identified\n\nYet the insurance industry has lagged with AI, as the legacy IT systems have been a burden.\u00a0So yes, Lemonade\u2019s founders saw this as a huge opportunity.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what the company has built:\n\nAI Maya:\u00a0This is an engaging virtual assistant that collects information, provides quotes and handles the payments.\u00a0\nAI Jim:\u00a0This is the claims bot.\u00a0For the most part, he has been able to handle roughly a third of the cases.\u00a0But even when a case is passed along to a human, the claim is generally much easier to work out because AI Jim has already done quite a bit of work on the matter.\u00a0\nCX.AI:\u00a0This is the bot that answers customer questions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLemonade\u2019s revolutionary model has completely changed the way we think about an antiquated industry,\u201d said Nick Liuzza, who is the CEO and co-founder of Beeline.\u00a0\u201cBy implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning directly into its model, the company can keep its costs low and bring savings back to the customer\u2014and this result rings true across many industries.\u201d\n\nMore Than About AI\n\nLemonade also has built something called the Forensic Graph, which uses AI and behavioral economics to predict, detect and block fraud.\u00a0So far, the company has avoided millions in potential losses.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn the case of Lemonade, we\u2019d expect the company\u2019s loss ratio and customer acquisition cost to be superior to legacy insurance carriers as a result of its AI technology,\u201d said Nima Wedlake, who is a Principal at Thomvest Ventures.\u00a0\u201cTo date, that isn\u2019t the case, though.\u00a0For example, its loss ratio in Q1 2020 was about 80% vs. about a 50% industry average.\u00a0However, Lemonade is still in its early days and I expect its unit economics to improve as the company scales.\u00a0If Lemonade can prove that it is more effective at underwriting risk using AI vs. legacy approaches, I expect more carriers to adopt similar approaches.\u00a0Many are already leveraging AI or ML as part of the underwriting process.\u201d\n\nYet there are skeptics.\u00a0In other words, AI may be more hype than substance.\n\n\u201cAt best AI could only help the company improve its actuarially ability, not see into the future and predict loss, which is of course, by definition, unknowable,\u201d said Kristopher Marsh, who is the editor of Discoverdando.com.\u00a0\u201cOtherwise there would be no need for insurance in the first instance. On the claims side, there may be some ability to automate payments, but this comes at the cost of leakage without human oversight.\u00a0If the company can process information to an above average quality, there may be a slight pricing advantage. Otherwise, their true advantage lies is in being able to operate without high labor overhead\u2014particularly in underwriting.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Lemonade does show that an immersive digital approach can be effective with customers.\u00a0Besides, when it comes to AI, there continue to be many breakthroughs.\u00a0The industry is still in the nascent stages.\n\n\u201cLemonade\u2019s successful IPO is about a new generation of digital insurance carriers coming to market and giving insurance incumbents, handicapped by technology constraints, a run for their money,\u201d said Michael Yang, who is the Managing Partner at OMERS Ventures.\u00a0\u201cLemonade is leveraging new consumer interactions and creating data sets that allow it to offer the right product to the right person on the right proportional risk basis that the incumbents can\u2019t.\u00a0Whether that\u2019s through AI or not, or alternatively, through a pretty user experience or not, is less the material point.\u00a0It\u2019s that Lemonade eschews the traditional broker and agent channel and has a direct relationship with the insured, which affords it more flexibility to innovate.\u201d\n\nTom (@ttaulli) is an advisor to startups and the author of Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction and The Robotic Process Automation Handbook: A Guide to Implementing RPA Systems.
